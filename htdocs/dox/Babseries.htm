of the Earth-Minbari war (see<i> In</i> <i>the Beginning</i>) it was proposed
that a space station be built to act as neutral territory to better enable
diplomatic solutions and prevent another war. The Babylon Project was set up
and a space station built, unfortunately </span><span style='font-family:Arial;

  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> 5 was the last attempt and was co-sponsored by both the
Earth and Minbar governments. It would be run as an Earthforce station but
subject to overview by an advisory committee comprised of representatives from
the main galactic powers – Earth, Minbar, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Centauri</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Republic</span><span style='font-family:

League of Non-Aligned Worlds would maintain representatives on the station and
have access to the Advisory Council.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Commander
Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O’Hare), a hero of the war and a participant in the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Battle</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> of the Line – Earth’s last ditch defence against the
superior Minbari forces, was chosen by the Minbari to take charge of the station.
This was a surprise to all parties, and an indication that the Minbari had a
hidden agenda. Shortly after his arrival on the station, Sinclair is accused of
attempting to poison the newly arrived Vorlon ambassador, Kosh (Wayne
Alexander). Vorlons inhabited encounter suits when in the presence of other
races, and nothing was known about their appearance or their physiology,
however with the aid of station telepath, Lyta Alexander (Patricia Tallman) –
who was also the ‘witness’ who incriminated Sinclair, Dr Kyle was able to
provide a cure and the true perpetrator revealed as a rogue </span><img

(think holographic camouflage) to look like Sinclair) just before the Vorlon
fleet blew the station away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;In the
pilot the Minbari were vaguely androgynous with Ambassador Delenn played by an
actress (Mira Furlan) with prosthetics to make her look more masculine and her
voice deepened by an electronic effect. The station was also missing its ‘Cobra
Bays’ which would explain why it relied on its defence grid when the Vorlon
fleet attacked.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

after the pilot, this would allow for the addition of Cobra Bays and their
squadrons of <i>Starfury</i> fighter ships, the series introduced new characters,
Lt Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian), Dr Stephen Franklin (Richard
Biggs) and Talia Winters (Andrea Thomson) replacing Laural Takashimi (Tamlyn
Tomita) (no explanation), Dr Kyle (recalled to Earthdome as head of
Xenobiology) and Lyta Alexander (recalled to Earthdome (or more likely the Psi
Corps facility on Mars) for debriefing after her ‘experience’ of Kosh) and
revamped the look of the alien ambassadors with Delenn ditching her prosthetics
and regaining her own voice (Minbari were now ‘sexed’ and gained a blue ‘stain’
on their heads), Londo Mollari (Peter Jurasik) of Centauri was made a little
younger and had the customary Centauri hair style tidied up a little, G’Kar
(Andreus Katsulas) of the Narn had a change of lipstick (not really noticeable)
and Kosh gained a flashing vocoder panel. The ambassadorial staff were beefed
up with the addition aids Lennier (Bill Mumy) to Delenn, Vir (Stephen Furst) to
Londo and Na’toth (Caitlin Brown) to G’Kar. The only remaining ‘human’ lead
from the pilot other than Sinclair was Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) the head
of security with a flawed past. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=111 height=149 src="Babseries_files/image006.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>This first
season was pretty slow at times and comprised mainly of stand alone stories
though elements of the great arc were introduced in the very first episode and
built upon as the season progressed. During this season we learnt that Sinclair
had a ‘hole’ in his memory, during the </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Battle</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> of the
Line he ‘blacked out’ while preparing to ram a Minbari ship only to regain
consciousness after the Minbari surrender (see <i>In the Beginning</i> for full
details). We also learnt that Delenn was more than just an ambassador, she was
a member of the <i>Grey Council</i> (the ruling body of the Minbari, set up by the
legendary Valen, a Minbari not born of Minbari) and was there to monitor
Sinclair; if he remembered what </span><img width=87 height=153
src="Babseries_files/image007.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>happened during the Battle of the Line she would have to
deal with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'><br>
We were introduced to the basics of intergalactic politics; the Narn were
aggressive and had just won their freedom from Centauri slavery, The Centauri
were a fading empire, the Minbari were comprised of three castes (Warrior,
Religious and Worker) and while a powerful force, were secluded and secretive,
while the Vorlons were very old, very powerful and very mysterious – heck Kosh
even spoke in riddles. The Narn and Centauri were consequently at each others
throats, the League of Non-Aligned worlds squabbled a lot, the Minbari remained
aloof and the Vorlons were the Vorlons and when they spoke everyone jumped (at
least they did if they understood what the Vorlons had said).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>A two part story
revealed that the dead planet, Epsilon III, which the station orbited was not
quite so dead, as deep within its bowels there was the Great Machine, looked
after by the last of its creator race (and then replaced by Draal one of
Delenn’s mentors), the Great Machine was a great power within its own right,
though tended to act as a repository for knowledge and otherwise keep itself to
itself. This was followed by a return visit by Babylon 4, which had it was
revealed, become unstuck in time while being taken by unknown forces (though
the denouement of the episode revealed these forces to include an aged Sinclair
and an off screen Delenn) to serve as a base for the forces of light in a great
war against darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>A number of
stories dealt with the Psi Corps and resident telepath, Talia Winters. Talia
was rated a T5 commercial telepath but a confrontation with her old mentor, the
victim of Psi Corps experiments to create a stable telekinetic, left her with </span><img
width=178 height=149 src="Babseries_files/image008.jpg" align=left hspace=4><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>minor (push a penny) telekinetic
abilities. We were also introduced to her ex, who was also the result of a Psi
Corps in emotional telepathy (empathy), and to Psi Cop Alfred Bester (Walter
Koenig). At one point Talia was engaged by Kosh to scan a being, who was
revealed to be a cyborg and who then gave Kosh a recording of Talia’s persona;
Kosh said this was ‘for the future.’ </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The key problem
faced by the station in the early part of the season was an organised fleet of
raiders, who seemed able to attack ships at will and escape before Earthforce
ships could arrive. However, midway through the season a visitor to the station
would change this forever. The visitor was Mr Morden (Ed Wasser), a human, who
upon arriving visited all the leaders of the alien races, he asked them all one
question: “What do you want?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Most races
brushed him off as wasting their time, Delenn however manifested a warning
sigil on her forehead and told him to go while Kosh told him to leave as ‘they’
were not for him? Only Londo answered the question, as in a fit of pique he
told Morden that what he wanted was a return to the old ways, to when the
Centauri Republic were powerful and feared not seen as a. Londo’s outburst was
prompted by a political situation resulting from the Narn maintaining a colony
on the edge of Centauri space; a colony that the Centauri believed to be spying
upon them but which they were powerless to remove. Morden however took this as
a genuine answer and unwittingly Londo had entered his race into a Faustian
pact. Shortly after strange and unknown ships appeared and wiped out the whole
of the Narn colony. The Shadows had returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Throughout the
remainder of the season the Shadows gradually made their presence felt by
secretly aiding the Centauri regain their former ‘glory’ and declare war on the
Narn.&nbsp; Delenn became fixated on fulfilling a prophecy and suspicions of a
conspiracy in Earthdome bargain to surface. The season ended with Garibaldi being
shot (in the back by one of his own security team) while trying to foil a plot
to assassinate President Santiago, Sinclair proposing to Catherine,&nbsp; ISN

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Season 2 started
with the revelation that Sinclair had been recalled and sent to Minbar as
Earth’s first ambassador on that planet. We are told that the reason the
Minbari surrendered to the Earth was that when the captured and tested Sinclair
at the </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Battle</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> of the Line, they found that he had a
Minbari soul. Futher tests on other prisoners revealed that many had either
whole or part Minbari souls. As Minbari did not kill Minbari the religious
caste called the war off. This was then erased from Sinclair’s mind, resulting
in his ‘hole’. The new commander of </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Babylon</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> 5 was
appointed by Earthdome and was not a popular choice with the Minbari. Captain
John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) was career military and was responsible for
destruction of the Minbari battle cruiser the <i>Dark Star</i> during the war;
this was the only victory Earth had and earnt Sheridan the name <i>Star Killer</i>
amongst the Minbari.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> was responsible for the recovery of
Garibaldi, comatose since last season, as he persuaded Dr Franklin to use an
alien healing machine that the doctor had gained in the first season. The
machine worked by transferring life force between subjects and could result in
the death of the donor just as easily as the cure of the patient; Sheridan and
Franklin took turns as donor and Garibaldi was healed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Delenn emerged
from her cocoon a hybrid between minbari and human. She now had hair and softer
human features, while her minbari bone crest was smaller and her ears had moved
accordingly. Delenn was unaware of the developments concerning Sinclair and had
to adjust to the new commander.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
Narn-Centauri war escalated with the Centauri using illegal mass drivers to
smash the Narn Homeworld and then seize control. The Narn government was
overthrown and all its members, including G’Kar, were outlawed. G’Kar was
granted sanctuary on </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Back on Earth,
Vice-President Clark assumed the presidency and began a policy of tightening
Earth security. As a result of this an organisation known as the Nightwatch was
established and allowed to openly recruit members of Earthforce. Initially
enticed by the promise of a pay bonus for attending Nightwatch meetings,
members were soon drawn into something somewhat darker. One such member was
Zack (Jeff Conaway) who had replaced Garibaldi’s chief officer after Garibaldi
discovered who had shot him. Meanwhile Sheridan was revealed to be highly
suspicious of happenings back on Earth and, under the auspices of General Haig,
was forming his own conspiracy of light; initially consisting of Garibaldi,
Ivanova (who had served under Sheridan in the past) and Dr Franklin, who had
been discovered as running an underground ‘telepath railroad’ helping ‘rogue’
telepaths to escape the clutches of the corrupt Psi Corps. </span></p>

secret knowledge of an organisation of minbari and human agents lead by
Ambassador Sinclair from Minbar, and Draal who promised the resources of the
Great Machine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Lyta returned

learn that Anna, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Throughout the
season, the Shadows made more appearances, though still hiding behind the Centauri
military action. Meanwhile a <i>starfury</i> pilot, Warren Keffer (), attached
to </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> 5, had glimpsed a Shadow ship in
hyperspace and was carrying out his own investigations. The Narn though under
Centauri occupation were fighting a guerrilla war against the Republic and
still had some capital ships left, scattered throughout the galaxy. G’Kar
remained on B5, but began to suspect that an old evil was returning, one that
was recorded in the Book of J’Qon; effectively a Narn holy book. The power of
the Nightwatch continued to grow, with members being instructed to report any
signs of anti-Clark sentiment and to deal with such acts of ‘sedition’, often
in a violent way (think Nazis). Earth signed a non aggression pact with the
Centauri, which put </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> in the line of fire as he was offering
aid to a Narn destroyer at the time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>At the
conclusion of the season two revelations were made. The first was the discovery
of the Shadows. Keffer once more encountered a Shadow ship in hyperspace, and
before it destroyed his <i>starfury </i>was able to video it. Back on the
station </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> was the victim of an assignation attempt
by the Centauri, when a bomb was put in the core shuttle car he was travelling
in. Forced to jump from the shuttle he was left falling, slowly towards the
gardens of </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> 5; the core shuttle runs down the centre
of the station, while below the interior gardens (a source of oxygen and food
on the stations) slowly rotate. </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s
fall was slow, but the impact would have been lethal. He was saved by Kosh, who
leaving his encounter suit revealed an angelic being that flew up an guided him
down safely. Interestingly each race present saw a different though similar
being from their mythology, except for Londo who saw nothing. With Kosh
revealed, or so we believed, ISN then broadcast the video Keffer recorded of
the Shadow ship, the recording had been retrieved from hyperspace and ended
with the Shadow ship firing straight to camera…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>This season
starts with a bang. Earthdome officials arrive on B5 to question the
ambassadors about the strange and mysterious ship that was recorded on video.
None of them have seen a ship like this before, although both Delenn and Londo
know ‘who’ it is and keep quiet about it. Only G’Kar has anything to say,
pointing to a drawing in the Book of J’Qon; it is a Shadow ship. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>An escape pod
arrives at B5, it contains Marcus Cole (Jason Carter) who is revealed as one of
Sinclair’s agents; the Anla Shok, the Rangers. Delenn and Garibaldi reveal the
existence of the Rangers to Sheridan and Marcus reveals that a Ranger training
complex has been blockaded by Shadow forces. He only managed to escape at the
cost of many lives, and he needs help to free them. </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> agrees but says he has no ship: that isn’t a problem as the
Rangers have – The<i> White Star</i>. </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>
takes the <i>White Star</i>, a prototype ship combining Vorlon and Minbari
technologies, and they succeed in blasting a way through the blockade so the
Rangers can escape. Before they can leave, a Shadow ship arrives and engages
the<i> White Star.</i> For the first time a ship takes on the Shadows and wins,
albeit by a technicality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Throughout the

indeed through the use of the Great Machine Ivanova retrieved evidence that </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Santiago</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>’s assassination was arranged by Clark, but that it includes
the Psi Corp and there is a link to the Shadows themselves. It seems that this
deal includes supplying the Shadows with telepaths, who are then merged into
Shadow ships, providing a living computer system. </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> is able to rescue a shipment of telepaths who are being
shipped in cryogenic suspension, but is unable to free them as they have had
Shadow tech implants inserted causing them to bond to whichever computer system
they are nearest when they awake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Clark</span><span

cracking down on contact with alien governments. Martial law is declared and
the Nightwatch is ordered to take over B5. Needless to say that the Nightwatch
are stopped, betrayed by Zack who finally realises what they are becoming. Lyta
returned (upgraded we find out) working for Kosh</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Midway through the
season a two part story sees Sinclair return to the station, and take Sheriden,
Delenn and Marcus back through time in the <i>White Star</i> (via a portal
maintained by the Great Machine), their mission is to secure Babylon 4 and take
it back in time. It seems the forces of Light mentioned when B4 popped up in
the first season were the Minbari, Vorlons and their allies against the Shadows
in the last Shadow war. It is revealed that the Shadows had nearly beaten the
forces of Light, but </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> 4 appeared, a gift from Valen, and it
became a staging post around which the allies could reform and finally beat the
Shadows back.&nbsp; Whilst in the unstable time field Sheridan and Delenn both
experience a flash forward in time; Sheridan finds himself and Delenn a captive
of Londo, while Delenn is disturbed by a visitor at while she watches Sheridan
sleep. At the conclusion of this story we see that Sinclair has gone back in
time with B4 and using the machine that Delenn used for her change, has become
a Minbari; Sinclair was Valen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Delenn breaks
the <i>Grey Council</i> and B5 secedes from Earth. The Shadows step up their
campaign, openly attacking ships and encouraging members of the Non-Aligned
worlds too fight amongst themselves. In a bid to draw support against the
Shadows, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> forces Kosh to commit the Vorlon fleet
to an attack. The Vorlons do engage the Shadows and in retaliation Morden and
‘friends’ visit Kosh, and kill him. The Vorlons replace Kosh, but his
replacement (Ulkesh though he says to call him Kosh) is much more aggressive.</span></p>

  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> proposes to Delenn, and in the way of her people, Delenn has
to watch her intended sleeping. It is during this that Delenn is disturbed by
…..Anna Sheridan. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> is distraught as he was told by Delenn
and Kosh that she was killed by the Shadows. This is what they had thought, but
</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> asks Dr Franklin to run medical checks,
which indicates that Anna may have been merged with a Shadow ship. Kissing
Anna, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> realises that his wife is dead, and this
is just her body. Accepting her invitation to the Shadow home world, Z’ha’dum, </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> hijacks the <i>White Star</i>, and takes them to the
planet. Once there the Shadows’ representatives, including Morden, explain how
the Shadows seek to build strength out of conflict and that </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> is in their way. Rather than kill him, and allow someone
else to step up, they will take out his support network, unless he joins with
them. As this discussion is taking place Shadow ships surround B5. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> draws a PPG (<i>Phased Plasma Gun</i>)
and shoots his way out of the room and escapes passed the waiting Shadows into
a corridor. Coming to a dead-end, overlooking the Shadow city, </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> triggers a program on the orbiting <i>White Star</i>,
arming two thermonuclear bombs and setting the ship in motion. </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> then hears Kosh telling him to jump, and so he does, just
as the White Star crashes through the Shadow city’s dome and detonates on
impact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Back at B5, the

up on Centauri Prime, looking as though he has terminal sunburn. Londo is
shocked to learn that Emporer Cartagia has granted Morden’s “associates” a base
on an island on Centauri Prime. G’Kar meanwhile has left in search of
Garibaldi, but is captured by the Centauri and tortured by Cartagia. Something
that Londo finds distasteful, and realising that Cartagia is mad, makes an

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Things are now
getting serious, the Shadows and the Vorlons are openly attacking other races, but
not each other. Ulkesh is a liability and so plans are made to deal with him,
this takes the efforts of Sheridan, Lorien and Kosh as well as a barrage of PPG
fire. In the conflict Ulkesh leaves his encounter suit and we see a very
different Vorlon to the angelic form they usually employ. With Ulkesh’s death
Kosh too dies, and </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> collapses. Lorien restores his life but
confides with Delenn that he can only fan the flame and so </span><span

are now openly attacking other races, and have now brought out the big guns;
planet killers. The coalition is begins to counter attack, while Lorien leads a
search for those few first ones (elder races) that did not go beyond the rim
after the last Shadow war. A trap is then set and the Vorlon and Shadow fleets
lured together. After a battle the Shadows and Vorlons sieze control of
Sheriden and Delenn. They put their sides of the situation; they are first ones
who took the responsibility of looking after the younger races, but the Shadows
with their belief in chaos and the Vorlons with their need for order lost the
plot. Unbeknown to either party, Lorien has broadcast this to all the other races,
and when Sheridan tells Vorlons and Shadows both where to go, the other races
close in on Sheriden’s ship and protect it from Shadow/Vorlon retaliation.
Seeing this, the Shadows and Vorlons agree to go beyond the rim with Lorien and
the other first ones, leaving the younger races to make their own choices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>While this
confrontation is taking place, Londo and Vir are doing some house clearing,
resulting in the destruction of the Shadow base, and the death of Morden. As a
Vorlon planet killer arrives and takes aim at Centauri Prime, Londo begs for
mercy, and decides that the only way to spare the planet is to offer his corpse
as the last thing touched by the Shadows. Luckily for him </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>With this war
over Sheridan turns his attention to the problems on Earth and uses the Great
Machine’s transmitters to beam the truth across the galaxy, to counter the
propaganda being spread by the now Clark controlled ISN. Unfortunately much of
this is targeted at Sheridan himself, and designed to undermine his
credibility. Despatching Marcus and Dr Franklin to Mars, </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> contacts the Free Mars resistance and offers them his
support, if they in turn support him. Meanwhile back on the station, Garibaldi,
who has resigned his commission, comes under the influence of William Edgars,
the richest man on Mars who is also married to Garibaldi’s former sweetheart,
and is convinced to assist in the capture of </span><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Now on Mars,
Garibaldi betrays Edgars and is met by Bester who tells him that all this was
programmed into him. Garibaldi now realises that he has both betrayed the
Captain, and caused handed the Psi Corps all of Edgars’ secrets (including
bio-weapon that is targeted to Psi actives). Garibaldi contacts the resistance,
and narrowly escapes execution; Dr Franklin insists that Lyta scan him, this
reveals the truth about his programming. With Garibaldi’s knowledge of Mars
security, they are able to rescue </span><span style='font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Delenn and
Lennier responding to reports of unrest on Minbar, have a run in with the
Drakh, a race allied to the now departed Shadows, and then have to forge an
unlikely alliance to resolve things on Minbar, reforming the <i>Grey Council</i>.
Meanwhile G’Kar and Londo join forces to forge a new InterStellar Alliance out
of the races of the war coalition. </span></p>

is then staged on Mars, which cuts of any chance of Martian assistance to </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=s5></a><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Season
5 “The Wheel of Fire”</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>This season very
nearly didn’t happen, as a result some of its stories had already been told,
and others which should have been started in the previous season were shoehorned
into this one. As a result, this season, while still of high quality, is
somewhat less satisfying than the previous two. In addition, Claudia Christian
chose not to return and so Ivanova was written out and Captain Elizabeth
Lochley (Tracy Scoggins) was written in. Incidently Lochley was revealed to be
another ex wife of Sinclair much to Delenn’s (and the audience’s) surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>With Earth now
free of Clark’s corrupt administration, Delenn pregnant with Sheridan’s son and
the InterStellar Alliance taking its first steps, trouble is just around the
corner.B5 becomes a sanctuary for a group of rebel telepaths, lead by the
charismatic Byron (Robert Atkins Downes), while Alliance member races come
under attack from unknown, and deadly, raiders. A bad situation is also made
worse by Garibaldi’s lapse into alcoholism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Byron becomes
involved with Lyta, and we discover that the Vorlons were responsible for the
development of telepaths throughout their ‘flock’ of races. In effect we see
that members of these races were treated like lab rats, while they cultivated
the psi gene. Byron’s efforts to secure a free planet for telepaths go
disastrously wrong, resulting in a siege and the eventual sacrifice of Byron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The attacks on
the </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Alliance</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> ships are revealed to be the result of
Centauri ships, but as Londo discovers, they are not part of the Centauri
fleet. It seems that in revenge for the defeat of the Shadows, the Drakh have
come to Centauri Prime and have taken control of the Regent through a parasitic
‘keeper’ that has bonded to his central nervous system. Franklin and Lyta
working under cover on the Drazi home world discover evidence that the Centauri
ships behind the attack are being controlled by Shadow control units.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The White Star
fleet rush to Centauri Prime, but are too late to stop a combined attack by
Drazi and Narn forces. In the Centauri Imperial palace Londo comes into contact
with the Drakh, who offer him a deal he can not refuse. He will be made Emperor
and hostilities will cease, in return the Centauri will secede from the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Alliance</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> and act as secret hosts for the Drakh. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>As the series
draws to a close Sheridan relocates his family to Minbar, Lennier, consumed
with jealousy tries to murder Sheridan and goes on the run and a gift from Londo,
to be presented to Sheridan’s son when he comes of age, contains a hidden
keeper. G’Kar and Lyta leave for deep space, as Lyta is finding herself
alienated by her growing psi abilities and G’Kar is regarded as a religious
figure by his own people due to his experiences with the Centauri. Garibaldi
recovers from his return to the bottle with the aid of both Lochley and his
future wife Lise Hamilton-Edgars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The final
episode of the series was made at the end of the fourth season and consequently
includes Ivanova, but doesn’t include Lochley. It is twenty years after the
founding of the </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Alliance</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> and </span><span style='font-family:
  Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s
life is coming to an end. A meal is held on Minbar for all their old friends.
At the conclusion of the meal, it is announced that Delenn will take over as
president, while Ivanova will assume command of the Rangers. When his time is
nearly up, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> ‘borrow’s a <i>White Star</i> and visits
B5, just in time to say good bye as the station will now be decommissioned and
destroyed. The final switch is thrown (by JMS in a cameo role) and while </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> watches, we see B5 self destruct. Taking his <i>White Star</i>
to the area of space where the final confrontation with the Shadows and Vorlons
took place, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> is met by Lorien, who has come to take
him beyond the rim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Back on Mimbar,
Delenn sits and watches the sunrise, beside her sits the spirit (we suppose) of
