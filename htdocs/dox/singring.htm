align=right hspace=4><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Singing
Ringing Tree, with a name like that it could be a fairy tale.</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> Well it is, but as far as I know it was
an original tale and not sourced from the Grimm boys or Hans C Anderson. So
saying that it does manage to include most of the themes from Germanic folklore
all in one go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Made in </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Germany</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>, this uber-fable was imported to the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>UK</span><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'> by the BBC and overdubbed with an English narrative. It was shown
as part of the Tales from </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Europe</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> series and is now available on DVD as a
box set with its contemporary ‘The Tinderbox’.  While ‘The Tinderbox’ is a
cracking production in itself, the star of the set is ‘The Singing Ringing
Tree’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The DVD however
contains a new narration, as apparently the original BBC version has been
‘lost’ like so many gems of the early years of TV (including loads of Doctor
Who and other classics like early Dads’ Army), however as I can not remember
the original, I am that old but couldn’t say if I had seen it before, I find
the version presented here more than satisfactory. Made in glorious colour,
that appears now with a pleasing mellow dreamlike quality, and sporting the
most ridiculous fish in TV history, this is a story that holds true to the
spirit of myth and fantasy, while also appealing to my Pagan self too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'><img width=200 height=25
src="singring_files/image002.gif"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>So settle
back and I will relate to you the story of the Singing Ringing Tree:</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=104 height=129 src="singring_files/image003.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>A prince rides
to a palace for an appointment with the King. He has come to woo the princess,
but she is not a very nice person as he will soon find out. Arriving in the
throne room the prince approaches the princess, while she finds him attractive
she is too proud to settle just for his looks. She asks him what gifts he has
for her, but when he presents her with a box of jewels she looks at it with
contempt and dismisses him. He asks her what she would consider a fitting gift
and she tells him of the singing ringing tree, which, she has heard, is most
suitable. The prince vows that he will find the tree and bring it back for her.
He returns to his horse and rides out on his quest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The prince rides
all over the kingdom and asks everyone he meets if they know where he can find
this magic tree. Eventually he comes to a ravine with a bridge made of natural
rock leading to a cavern. He leaves his </span><img width=104 height=125
src="singring_files/image004.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>horse and crosses the bridge unaware that an evil looking
dwarf is watching him. The prince finds that the cavern is a tunnel that leads
to a hidden valley, and venturing through it he is surprised when the dwarf
appears and starts berating him for trespassing. Calming the dwarf, the prince
asks him if he has heard of the Singing Ringing Tree. To his surprise the dwarf
has and produces the tree itself (it doesn’t look much, its just a few twigs
and some leaves). The dwarf says that the prince can take the tree, but that it
will only sing in the presence of true love; he will only have until sunset to
make the princess love him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The prince
boasts that there will be no problem doing that and stupidly enters into a
wager with the dwarf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Returning to the
palace, the prince hands over the tree, but the princess is too disappointed by
the tree (well I did say it doesn’t look much, and of course it isn’t singing
or ringing) and throws it back at the prince. As the prince rides off, the
princess realises that he was the best of the many suitors she has rejected and
regrets her decision. She tells her father that she was being too hasty and
asks him to send some men to bring him back. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=130 height=98 src="singring_files/image005.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The prince
arrives back at the rock bridge, he is distraught to realise that the sun is
setting; as it does the prince changes, becoming a bear. The dwarf appears and
out of spite turns the prince’s horse to stone. The dwarf retreats at the sound
of approaching horses, and the bear hides. The Kings men arrive and spying the
Singing Ringing Tree by a rock, shaped somewhat like a rearing horse, pick it
up. Before they can investigate the rock bridge, the bear rushes out and the
men ride of with the Singing Ringing Tree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Back at the
palace the princess is up in the loft watching for the prince to return. While
up there she disturbs the royal doves (well they might be wild doves but they
live in the palace so who knows) and is rather beastly too them (she will
regret this later). Seeing the horses coming back, she rushes down to meet
them, only to be told the prince had vanished (may be the bear ate him?) but
they have the tree. She takes the tree and shakes it, commanding it to ring or
sing, but nothing happens (the tree by the way has bare roots and having been
thrice carried across the kingdom on horse back without soil or water is
probably in a bit of a sulk).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>That night the
princess sleeps with a maid holding the tree by her bed. She is to wake the
princess when it starts to sing. The next morning the princess is annoyed
because the tree is still silent (try planting it, dingbat) and she takes her
frustration out on the poor maid. Going into the garden, the princess has a
‘Ground Force’ moment and decides to plant the tree in the water feature. So
she pulls the plug and water and goldfish drain away (Charlie Dimmock would not
approve.) She plants the tree and nothing happens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Meanwhile the
bear has made a plan. He secretly returns to the palace, dealing with a guard
left on the road by the King in case the bear followed his men. Arriving at the
palace garden the bear grabs the princess, who promptly faints (or should that
be ‘swoons’). The bear carries her back to the secret valley (passing the guard
from earlier who is hanging by his coat from a tree-he is a good bear after
all), hotly pursued by the King and his men. Once back in the valley, the dwarf
causes a big rock to fall and block the entrance. He then watches as the King
and company come to a dead end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=157 height=118 src="singring_files/image006.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The princess
comes round to see the bear and reacts with fright. The bear is sad, but leaves
her on her own. Over the next few days the princess watches the bear go about
his business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>She watches him
go to the lake and this big fish appears (it floats on top of the water –
weird), but when she approaches the fish swims off (he knows what she did to
the goldfish). She watches the bear with some doves, they aren’t afraid of him,
but when the princess appears they fly off. She watches the bear give hay to
this beautiful white horse with golden antlers (err, I wonder if they meant for
it to be a stag?), but when she appears it runs away. To cap it all, the evil
little dwarf , who has been watching with glee, casts a spell robbing her of
her beauty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Over the following
days the princess watches the bear start to make a home out of a cave. At first
she thinks it is for her, but he soon sets her straight. Deciding that she had
no choice but to help, and therefore get a chance at sharing the shelter. She
starts to collect rocks, and finds that by tearing her dress she can use it to
carry more. The bear is impressed that she is helping. She carries on helping
the bear and the more she does the more she begins to like him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Out in the
fields she comes across a dove with an injured wing and picks it up. Touched by
its pain she takes it to the bear, who treats its injury, After that the doves
no longer fly away from her. Later she is by the lake and the fish is swimming
(or should that be floating) by. The dwarf is watching and uses his magic to
freeze the lake, trapping the fish. Seeing the fish is in trouble the princess
makes her way across the ice, and on reaching him, she takes off her shoe and
starts hammering at the ice. The bear hearing the noise comes out and rushes to
help. Between them they free the fish and it floats off to clear water. The
dwarf is not happy,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The dwarf’s
winter is holding the valley in its grip, and the princess comes across the
antlered horse trapped in a gully. She tries to free him but the dwarf makes
more and more snow fall, threatening to bury them both.  Her cries for help
bring the bear, and together they free the horse. All her good deeds break the
dwarf’s spell and with each one, her beauty is restored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The dwarf is not
happy at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Later the dwarf
approaches the princess and tells her that he father, the King, is very ill.
She is distraught and wants to see him, so the dwarf removes the rock from the
tunnel and she runs home (just how far is the palace??). When the bear
discovers she is gone he is upset, and to stop him from following her, the
dwarf smashes the rock bridge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=130 height=109 src="singring_files/image007.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>When the
princess arrives back at the palace she finds the place deserted. Searching she
finds a servant and asks them where the King is. Not recognising the princess,
the servant tells her that the King and all his men are out searching for his
daughter who was stolen by a bear. Wandering into the garden, the princess
comes to the Singing Ringing Tree, which is still planted in the old water
feature; it is still silent. She thinks about what the dwarf said to her, and
realises it was a trick. She then starts to think about the bear, realising
that she has come to love him. It is true love, and as she realises this the
Singing Ringing Tree begins to shake, sing and ring (at last!!!). Grabbing the
tree (yes its going to be dragged bare rooted across the kingdom again), she
knows that she must go back to the bear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=104 height=104 src="singring_files/image008.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>As she
approaches the valley, she is seen by the dwarf who uses his magic to grow a
barrier of impenetrable thorns. Reaching the barrier the princess finds she
can’t go further, but just as she begins to fret, the antlered horse arrives,
leaping over the thorns. The princess climbs on to its back, and after taking a
run up, the horse leaps back over the barrier and races towards the valley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=130 height=104 src="singring_files/image009.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The dwarf uses
his magic again and causes the lake to flood. The water is too deep for the
horse, so the princess tries to carry on, on foot. She is having trouble, but
before she drowns the giant fish floats up. She climbs on the fishes back and
the fish carries her toward the valley. Hopping mad the dwarf stops the flood
and the water begins to disappear trapping the fish at the bottom of the
ravine. Who can the princess go on now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Suddenly a flock
of doves descends from the sky. They have some vines with them which the
princess can sit on, like a swing. The doves then carry her out of the ravine
and deposit her at the valley entrance (what has the bear been feeding them). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=130 height=98 src="singring_files/image010.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Rushing into
the valley, the princess is waylaid by the dwarf, who snatches the tree and
runs off. The princess chases him around the valley, and the bear when joins
in, but the dwarf is too quick. Finally cornered the dwarf shoves the tree into
the ground and surrounds it with a ring of fire. The princess is too afraid to
approach, but the tree sings and gives her courage. She walks through the flame
to reclaim the tree (very Wagnerian).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The tree now
sings and rings its little wooden heart out. The fire dies, the dwarf is
vanquished and the bear becomes the prince once more (and his horse is freed
too –yay!). Deciding to leave the tree in the valley in case someone else needs
it, they ride off into the sunset together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Oh I love
happy endings.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I am a little
confused though about the dwarf’s motives. So he gave the prince the tree just
to trap him, and maybe the princess too, but everything the dwarf did actually
encouraged the princess to change. Maybe he wasn’t as evil as he appeared?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>
