<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I believe
that all things possess both life and consciousness</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> whether they are animal, vegetable,
mineral, man-made or natural phenomena. So for me animals, trees, rivers,
rocks, rain, wind, tools and people are all alive, aware and equal. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=157 height=117
src="faithandfool_files/image001.jpg" align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I believe that
this consciousness is facilitated by an energy field that resides within all
things while also being part of a greater energy that permeates the entire
cosmos. This energy forms a web linking all things together regardless of
location and is itself alive and aware. I see this energy as the Divine Spirit
and believe that it comprises the souls of all things and the soul of the
universe itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I understand
that as all things are connected, they are able to interact and as such I
believe that the universe is dynamic; that it is in a state of constant change
and movement. Only the Divine Spirit remains constant, but even this too is in
motion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=157 height=118
src="faithandfool_files/image002.jpg" align=left hspace=4><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I believe that it is possible to commune
with the Divine Spirit by achieving a state of altered consciousness. While
this can be achieved via use of various chemical means (drugs, alcohol) I feel
that the same results can be achieved by meditation and trance work. A benefit
of these, non chemical dependent, methods is that you know that what you
experience is not just the result of the alien chemicals acting on your brain,
but a genuine experience. While those who use chemical methods will defend them
to the hilt, I would always find myself plagued with doubt over the source of
the experience. Not to mention the dangers inherent in meddling with the
natural human brain chemistry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>While I feel it
is possible to 'tune in' to the Divine Spirit I feel that it is much too large
to be fully interpreted by the feeble human mind. As a result I feel that what
we experience is only a small part of the whole and that we experience it only
in a form that our minds can accept. As a result the way one person experiences
communion would be different to the way another would. While there would likely
be some similarities between the experiences of people from the same culture,
the more different the cultural mindset, the more different the experience is
likely to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>While the human
mind may be incapable of fully understanding Divinity as a whole, there are
entities that are more fully integrated with the Spiritual Web and as such can
achieve a greater understanding. These entities may take the form of Deities to
humans, and it is possible to develop a working relationship with them to aid
you in your spiritual growth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=157 height=158
src="faithandfool_files/image003.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The deities that you work with, and if
indeed you work with any deities at all, is dependent on many factors,
including your cultural background, your mind's ability to comprehend the
Divine, and not least by your belief in the concept of 'Gods'. If for example
you do not personally believe in the idea of gods then it is unlikely that you
will attract a deity to work with you. Even if you should succeed in this it is
likely that you will not perceive the entity as a God at all, but maybe simply
as a spirit or even an elemental force. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>For those with
an inherent acceptance of deity then you may find yourself working one or more
beings that, again, you interpret on a personal level. If, for example, your
mind is geared to work well with generalisations you may find yourself working
with a generic 'God' and/or 'Goddess' that may be, as far as your understanding
goes, a multifaceted embodiment of the totality of 'gods' and 'goddesses'.  On
the other hand if your mind works better with compartmentalised concepts then
it is likely that you will find yourself encountering a variety of different,
and individual, deities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Whatever your mind's preference I believe that you are essentially
working with the same beings, its just that they are sensitive to the limits of
your understanding and as such allow you to perceive them in the way best
suited to you. I therefore believe that all interpretations of divinity are
valid and equal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>On the subject of gods, I believe that there are many diverse and
distinct entities that fulfil this role, however I also feel that though we
give them many names,   an individual 'god' may be known by more than just 
one. This makes sense to me as there are many deities in the world that have
similar roles, differing only in name, appearance and interpretation. Now to me
it seems likely that a god would use a name and appearance in keeping with the
culture of its followers, it does not seem particularly wise for a god to
demand that people learn a new language to communicate with it, and if its
actions are too different from the cultural norm, its advice is likely to go
over the heads of the local folk. Of course as these beings are individuals it
is also likely that some may decide to make things harder by breaking these
'rules' either as a test of faith or because the local mentality can not accept
and easy route. Then again, they might just be stubborn!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><img width=101 height=65
src="faithandfool_files/image004.gif" align=left hspace=12><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Part of my belief is the acceptance of
'magic'. Now the magic that I believe in is not the conjuring tricks of the
stage magician, but the 'true magic' of the universe. Magic works for me as I
believe that all things are connected no matter where they are located, so the
concept of working a change from a remote location is quite acceptable. I will
detail more on my understanding of 'magic' elsewhere on this site.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>In addition I do not believe in the 'supernatural', while it may
seem odd for me to say that, what I mean is that from my point of view
everything that occurs within Nature is natural, as such how can I describe
anything as being 'beyond' nature? Spirits, gods, and souls they are all linked
and part of the Divine Spirit. Even in regard to those things made by man, or
caused by man's actions, ultimately they are still </span><img width=200
height=140 src="faithandfool_files/image005.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>a part of Nature. Synthetics, like
plastic and nylon, may be man-made and resistant to natural reintegration, but
they are still manufactured from natural substances. Likewise, TV and radio
transmissions may be generated by man, but they are simply a case of us
exploiting and taming natural forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>So to sum up my beliefs, I believe that Nature I everything and
all things are a living and conscious part of Nature, I believe that there are
entities and forces that may aid us in our understanding of nature and that
these may be perceived as deities. I believe that magic is possible but that it
does not exceed the limits of Nature, and I believe that all concepts of the
Divine are equally valid.</span></p>
