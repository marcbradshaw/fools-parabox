align=right hspace=4><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Written by
Stephen R Donaldson,</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> The
Chronicles of Thomas Covenant are divided into three parts and tell the story
of Thomas Covenant, a bitter divorcee with leprosy, and his involvement with
the destiny of the mystical Land. The books are written with an emotional
intensity and an eye for detail that does make them seem a little impenetrable
at first, but once you have gotten into the flow of the story you soon begin to
feel for the characters and to get swept along with the emotions raised. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>One thing you
soon realise is that Thomas Covenant is not an easy man to like. While he has
been dealt a really bad hand in life, and his actions are understandable given
his circumstances, you do get the urge at times to slap him in the face and
give him a good shouting at!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Yes Thomas

is a bitter man. A successful author¸ he lost his family when he was diagnosed
with Hansen's disease – Leprosy; he also lost half the fingers on his left
hand. Retreating to a remote farm he lives a secluded life shunned and hated by
the inhabitants of the nearby town.  In each of the books of the first trilogy
he suffers a near death experience that appears to transfer him to another
world where he finds his fate linked to the wild magic and the people of The
Land.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>One neat thing
about the paperback editions I read was that the covers when opened out and

Seat, the watch tower where Kevin laid waste to the land, and where Covenant
first arrived. Sadly later editions had rather plain and boring covers.</span></p>

margin-right:2px'><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Covenant is
befriended by one of the people of Mithil Stonedown, a community where the
people have mastered the lore of the earth and stone. He is told that his
arrival is fulfilling a legend as he resembles one of the great high lords,
Berek Half-hand, and the wedding band he still wears is made of the metal of
wild magic – white gold. Covenant learns that when the Land was created an evil
being, Lord Foul the Despiser, was trapped there by the creator and can not
escape without breaking the arch of time and destroying the Land. The free
people are lead by the Council of Lords at the fortress Revelstone, who dedicate
themselves to protecting the Land and working with nature. During the last
battle with Foul, Lord Kevin, now known as Land-waster, used the most powerful
of magics, but instead of destroying Foul, he despoiled the Land. As a result
now much of the old lore is lost. It is hoped that Covenant’s appearance
signifies that Foul will be defeated once and for all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>It is at this
time that Covenant is introduced to one of the Land’s secrets, his cut and
injured body is daubed in a curative called ‘hurt-loam’, but rather than just
cure his cuts and bruises the hurt-loam restores Covenant’s long lost sense of
touch. This proves to be a costly recovery, as overcome by his restored
feelings, Covenant rapes Lena, the young daughter of his host. To spare
Covenant from the wrath of her husband Lena’s mother, Atiaran, escorts Covenant
on his journey to Revelstone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Taken before the
council of lords, Covenant is recruited for a quest to retrieve the long
thought lost, ‘Staff of Law’ from the depraved cavewight Drool Rockworm.  The
mission takes Covenant, a party of Lords and their ‘Bloodguard’, elite warriors
of the <i>Haruchai</i> people who are pledged to the service and protection of
the Lords, to the caverns of Mount Thunder and a confrontation with both Drool
and the Despiser. Falling in battle Covenant secures the escape of his allies
by tapping into the wild magic and waking the ‘fire-lions’, creatures of living
fire and lava. Covenant awakes back in his own world, only minutes have passed
for the weeks in the Land; was it just an hallucination?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Many years have
passed in the time of the Land and the Council of Lords is now headed by Elena,
Covenant’s daughter from his rape of Lena. Also allied to the Lords is Hile
Troy, blind from birth (he has no eyes) the magic of the Land has given him a
replacement sense that more than compensates. Troy is also from Covenants world
and is a superb strategist; a talent the Council hope will give them an
advantage in the coming war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Illearth
Stone has shifted the balance of power, and has even allowed one of Fouls
Ravers, bodiless spirits, to posses one of the friendly giant folk something
that was previously thought impossible. While Troy commands the Warward, the
forces of the free people, against the Raver led army of Foul, it is up to
Covenant to destroy the Stone and prevent Foul’s army from defeating the forces
of the Lords. Things do not go well; Elena, driven both by a love for her
father and a desire to destroy Foul, summons up the shade of Kevin Landwaster
in an ill-fated attempt to gain power but in the process breaks the Law of
Death, the Raver-Giant Kinslaughterer lives up to his name and kills the giants
and Troy is forced to make a bargain that will change his life forever.</span></p>

never have been. It is simply a chapter removed from the <a href="#tiw"><span
style='color:black'>Illearth War</span></a> as without Covenant’s presence it
was thought that the question of whether the Land was real, or just a figment
of Covenant’s imagination, would have been compromised. Silly really as by now
you probably didn’t care whether it was a dream or not, and as parts of the
story were from Hile Troy’s point of view, it seemed less likely that Covenant
was dreaming anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>However this
novelette, printed in very large type in an effort to bump up the page count,
recounts Korik’s mission, something that we learn of in the Illearth War but
stripped of all detail, and gain an insight into the Bloodguard and witness
just how unprepared some of the Lords are for their duties. That this chapter
should be told is for sure, but it should be within the main narrative and not
as an over priced addition. I first read it  after completing the Second
Chronicles, as it was published after the publication of <a href="#wgw"><span
style='color:black'>White Gold Wielder</span></a>, probably to generate more
revenue from the series rather than please the readers. I would recommend
reading it between the Illearth War and the Power that Preserves, as the story
will be more relevant.</span></p>

the Land, Covenant finds that seven years have passed since the failure of his
last mission. Times are fraught, the Land is gripped by an unnatural winter
(through Foul’s use of the Illearth Stone and the Staff of Law, unbeknownst to
the Council who thought it lost during the Illearth War), the Bloodguard Vow
has been sundered and the <i>Haruchai</i> have scattered, the Giants have been
exterminated (bar one as we shall see), the proud Ranyhyn (uber-horses that
consent to serve the Council in a way that paralleled the Bloodguard) and their
Ramen attendants are being hunted by Foul’s forces and the Earthpower is
weakening resulting in the fall of the mighty forests. Revelstone is under
siege and the Council are preparing to perform the Ritual of Desecration, the
same ritual that Kevin Land-waster used previously, in a desperate hope to
overcome Foul once and for all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Allied with the

mission of absolution which takes them across the wastes and into Fouls
fortress itself. Covenant finally confronts Foul, destroying both the Staff of
Law and the Illearth Stone, and redeems both the Land and himself while
diminishing Foul.</span></p>

and Covenant, redeemed by the trials of the First Chronicles, has returned to
writing and is now at peace with himself. Pulled back to the Land, Covenant is
first surprised to find his doctor, Linden Avery, has been drawn with him, and
then shocked to see the wreck that the Land has become.  Centuries have passed
since the fall of Foul, but in that time Foul has managed to infiltrate the
Earthpower itself, perverting it and bringing ruin and waste where once there
was life. Foul’s chief weapon is the Sunbane, manifest as a coloured corona to
the sun, each dawn the Sunbane changes, bringing suns of Desert, Fertility,
Rain or Pestilence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Avery is lost to
find herself in a strange world, and can only watch as Covenant is shocked by
the degree of perversion that Foul has worked on the once beautiful Land. With
each discovery Covenant is further enraged; the free people have lost their
knowledge of the lore of stone and wood and have been taught that to access the
Earthpower requires payment in blood. Where man once worked in harmony with
Nature, now Nature bleeds man to work the simplest of tasks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Covenant and
Avery journey across the Land finding that only the hills of Andelain, once the
most beautiful and peaceful areas of the Land, remain free of the Sunbane,
protected by the forestal Caer Caveral who Covenant once knew as Hile Troy. At
Revelstone they find the Council has also been perverted and now the free
people are ruled by the Raver possessed Clave, who’s Rede of bloodletting and
Banefire have usurped the old lore. Along the way Covenant and Avery are joined
by Vain, a product of the ur-viles (spawn of the Demondim and usually allied to
Foul), who seems destined for something big. At Revelstone Vain defies
analysis, though a group of Waynhim (good Demondim spawn and opposites of
ur-viles) is shocked by what they see, and seems to be operating to his own
agenda; pilfering the metal bands that were the last remains of the Staff of
Law, he places one on an ankle and the other on his opposite wrist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>At the end of
the book Covenant and party meet up with the Search, an expedition of Giants,
seeking their cousins who had settled in the Land centuries ago, and who
Covenant knows were slaughtered by Foul’s minions. By now the reader is used to
Covenant waking up in his own world, so imagine the shock when this book ends
with Covenant and Avery sailing away from the Land with the Giants to search
for a means to save the Land.</span></p>

and narrow squeaks that culminate with a quest to find the One Tree, the source
of the original Staff of Law. At the site of the One Tree we discover that the
tree itself is part of the giant serpent that encircles the universe
(Jormugandr anyone?) and the act of trying to remove a ‘branch’ results in
Covenant ‘visiting’ his own world to see his estranged family in danger and

confronts Foul, this time giving his life to become one with the wild magic and
finally, at least as far as we can tell, defeat the Despiser. With Covenant
dead, Avery takes up the white gold and with the powers of wild magic, the new
Staff of Law and her innate powers destroys the Sunbane and finally is returned
