Divine</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If there is one thing that
puzzles most pagans it is probably the question 'what are the gods?' To some
they are powerful entities, each with their own motives and attributes, while
to others each god is no more than a single aspect of a multifaceted Divinity.
In fact some would say there are no 'gods' at all and they simply relate to the
forces they interpret as the spirit or spirits of Nature itself. So who is
right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well in my opinion, and this is a subject where opinions are
all that we can put forth, the truth is: there is no one answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think I would be safe in saying that pagans all accept
there is some kind of life spirit within humans and other creatures, and many
would extend this spirit both into the realm of plants and also to those
features of this planet otherwise classed as inanimate, rocks, rivers, the
weather etc... It is my belief that this spirit permeates all things to excess
and it is from this spirit that the entities we call 'gods' spring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I do not mean to imply that there <i>is</i> only one
Divinity after all; rather this spirit provides the substance, which gives the
gods form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why do some see many gods while others see only one or
none at all?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That I believe is down to Man, or rather to the limitations
and idiosyncrasies of our minds in the interpretation of the information from
our senses. Now I am not saying that you have a faulty noggin if you believe in
a god only that your perception of a god is shaped by your mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of us is unique, and the workings of our mind as much a
product of our experiences as our genetics. Some of us are quite happy to
except things at face value while others feel the need to deconstruct things
and label the parts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those whose first instinct is to grab a Dymo and start
clacking out strips of letter embossed self adhesive plastic, are unlikely to
be comfortable dealing with faceless powers whereas those who feel no need for
labels or who do not accept the existence of 'gods' are more than happy to
interact directly with the spirit/energy itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So put bluntly, what l believe is that when you seek out the
Divine what you find is what you need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If you are seeking to join with the living spirit of the
     planet and the natural forces themselves, you may find the Divine as a
     single or multiple faceless 'force'.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If you view everything in terms of balanced opposites the
     Divine might present itself to your senses as male and female
     archetypes-the God and Goddess of Wicca.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:18.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If you seek to build a relationship with the Divine but
     this would be hindered by dealing with impersonal forces you might find that
     the spirit forms that come to you take on a face and name for your
     convenience.&nbsp; This is not to imply that these god forms are only a
     construct for your benefit. Rather they are pre-existing beings formed
     from nodes of the Divine spirit. Each one a complete individual with their
     own attributes and motives.&nbsp;&nbsp; The form they adopt in their
     dealings with you is simply tailored to suit your perceptions and
     expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So in effect whether you choose to honour the Divine as
elemental forces or as a well-defined god, though the methods differ the end
result is the same. Indeed when you deal with a god there is no reason that
this entity may not also have dealings with others, but under a different name.
There are after all, many deities that encompass similar attributes throughout
the many cultures on this Earth, may be their only differences are&nbsp;&nbsp;
nothing more than the variances of cultural mindsets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So in conclusion if my assertions are true then we can
easily see that the many different paths, not only within paganism but also
those 'mainstream' religions, have more in common than many would suppose. Of
course these are only my thoughts, and whether they are right or wrong the gods
just aint saying.</p>
