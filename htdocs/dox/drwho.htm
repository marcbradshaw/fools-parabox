would both entertain and educate. To do so the format decided on would concern
travel through both time and space to facilitate the opportunity to cover both
historical and scientific subjects. To better engage the viewers it was decided
to feature a ‘family’ group in the series and the members would be as followed:</span></p>

be as alien to 1960s Earth as the 1960s would be to someone from today. It was
thought that a younger character would enable children to empathise and see the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>The idea behind the characters of Ian and Barbara was that as they
were school teachers they would be someone the viewer felt they could trust,
the Doctor after all was a little untrustworthy – at least initially. The fact
that they were teachers also gave an ideal way for facts to be fed to the
viewer during the course of the adventures.</span></p>

align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
credit for Doctor Who can not really be laid at the hands of any one person
however it is generally agreed that chief amongst those responsible were Sydney
Newman, who as BBC Head of Drama commissioned the series and Verity Lambert who
was the series original producer. It would however be unfair to overlook the
contributions made by the designer of the original TARDIS interior (Peter Brachacki),
the author of the pilot and first serial (Anthony Coburn, developed from an
idea by CE (Cecil Edwin) Webber), Warris Hussain (director of the pilot and
first serial) and the creators of the iconic title sequence (visuals by Bernard
Lodge, theme composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire and the
BBC Radiophonic Workshop). </span></p>

align=right hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Of course there is one person who revolutionised the show, much to
Sydney Newman’s distaste: Terry Nation. Newman was adamant that the show be
educational and not be an excuse for ‘bug-eyed monsters’, but the success of
the second serial’s BEMs the Daleks made the inclusion of further ‘monsters’ a
given thing; even to the extent of bringing back the Daleks who had been killed
off in the first story.  </span></p>

align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
initial story concerned Ian and Barbara (William Russell and Jacqueline Hill)
giving in to their combined suspicions about Susan (Carole Anne Ford) and
following her home to what appeared to be an old junkyard. Going in they could
find no trace of Susan, but did find and old Police Box, an unlikely item of
scrap. They were taken by surprise by a somewhat abrasive old man (the Doctor,
William Hartnell) who demanded to know what they were doing in his yard.
Hearing Susan’s voice from inside the Police Box they forced their way past the
Doctor, and found themselves inside a room which was much larger than possible
and also alive with circuitry: it was the product of a technology undreamt of
at that stage in Earth’s history.  A confrontation between the old man and the </span><img
width=133 height=151 src="drwho_files/image008.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>teachers resulted in the
Doctor ‘accidentally’ launching the Ship. All this was the pilot episode
(though the original pilot was deemed unsuitable at the time by Newman, and it
was remade with a few changes) and the episode ended with the TARDIS arriving
in (what is assumed to be) the past where the group came up against a tribe of primitives
who have lost the ability to make fire. This first story introduced such
mainstays as the Doctor and his associates being imprisoned and having to
escape, and for the need to return to the Ship (the TARDIS) for safety. It
wasn’t however until the second story and the introduction of the series iconic
‘monsters’ the Daleks, that Doctor Who became a ‘must see’.</span></p>

although he looks human is one of that planets ruling elite: The Time Lords.
The Doctor refers to himself simply as ‘the Doctor’; no other names are used,
unless required for deception or convenience, when the usual choice is Dr John
Smith.</span></p>

(allowing him to close his lungs and re-breath the air trapped inside for a
short period), a degree of telepathy and the ability to undergo a complete
cellular metamorphosis when his life is threatened with death. This technique
has come to be called ‘regeneration’ and was introduced to allow the
replacement of the lead in what was now a very popular TV show. The ability to
regenerate has become part of the Time Lord physiology and has been limited to a
total number of 12 occurrences, though one would assume that this could be
gotten around when the need for a fourteenth Doctor arrives. </span></p>

font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Doctor is considered a renegade within Time
Lord society, as he believes that evil should be confronted wherever possible
and as such he constantly breaks the sacrosanct Time Lord laws of
non-intervention, something that pro-intervention Time Lord factions have not
been slow to exploit. At least twice his fellow Time Lords have tried the
Doctor for his ‘crimes’, but this did not stop him at one stage becoming their
Lord President; at least for a short while.</span></p>

font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Doctor is morally opposed to violence and
never carries a gun; however he does bow to the inevitable and resort to force
when there is no other avenue available to him. His greatest weapons are his
mind and its vast resources of scientific and esoteric knowledge. Of course
bumming around history hasn’t stopped him picking up a few useful tricks from
such people as Houdini; and he is not afraid to drop a few names.</span></p>

ship, which is called the TARDIS and although originally thought to be unique
is merely one of many such time capsules manufactured by the Time Lords. Due to
the Time Lord philosophy of non-intervention, the TARDIS has defences but no
weapons systems. </span></p>

font-family:Arial;color:red'>Companions</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'> - One or more companions usually accompany the
Doctor in his travels. This was initially to enable an exchange of information
and to allow the programme to educate its viewers, but now more for the case of
narrative flow. Over the years the TARDIS has seen a number of different
companions, though most seem to be attractive young ladies (which became known
as the Crumpet Factor, when they were seen as a way to maintain the attention
of fathers after the afternoon sports programme). The number of companions
varied and included, at two different times, the robots K-9 (mk1 and mk2) and Kamelion.
A number of companions did not survive their time with the Doctor: Katarina, </span><span

font-family:Arial;color:black'> – The use of the TARDIS meant that adventures
could take place on different planets and different time periods. With the
exception of the early third Doctor UNIT stories, where he was exiled to Earth,
it was rare that the location was used as a base for more than one story. 
However it must be mentioned that according to the Doctor’s travels there are a
lot of planets out there that look like quarries.</span></p>

font-family:Arial;color:black'>The series ran from 1963 until 1987 without
interruption (though there was a period when the series was rested for a year;
the reason given being to allow the show to be brought up to date however most
fans believe it was more to do with BBC office politics).  During this time the
Doctor underwent six regenerations and was therefore portrayed by seven
different actors. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'>Unfortunately as the years went by BBC budgets
did not match those available to </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
  font-family:Arial;color:black'>US</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'> productions and this became particularly
noticeable after the arrival of the first Star Wars film (which is really
number four – and they say UNIT chronology is difficult) and the flurry of US
TV wannabes that followed. As a result, while the stories retained a degree of
quality the finished effect was often spoilt by the limitations in production.
At the same time the BBC were beginning to chase ratings (something that is
unnecessary as being funded by the TV license fee the Beeb has a guaranteed
income) and decided to experiment with scheduling (note putting a genre programme
on against one of the biggest soap operas on TV (Coronation Street) is not a
good idea) resulting in a fall in perceived popularity. Ironically at the time
of cancellation the series had begun to regain some of its previous strengths
and indeed its popularity was once more beginning to rise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'>This however was not the end. The BBC licensed
Virgin Publishing to produce a range of original full-length novels to
essentially carry on the story. To do so Virgin published both a range of
stories featuring the then present seventh Doctor, and a series of ‘Missing
Adventures’ featuring previous Doctors and set between transmitted TV stories. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'>It was within the seventh Doctor stories that
the most change would be seen. Titled <i>The New Adventures of Doctor Who</i>, the
series continued from where the TV series finished, and promised stories both
bigger and bolder than previously possible. This probably explains why the
first book opened with the Doctor’s teenage companion Ace, wandering around the
TARDIS in her </span><img width=83 height=138 src="drwho_files/image014.jpg"

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black'>The first change to hit readers was that after a
number of books, the character of Ace was written out and a new companion,
Benny, was introduced. A couple of books later and Ace was back, however she
had now grown up and become a fully fledged, hard as nails, space commando with
her own hidden agenda. </span></p>

Doctor was played by Paul McGann and he was teamed up with an American heart
surgeon, Grace (Daphne Ashbrook) who inadvertently ‘kills’ a critically injured

around the turn of the millennium and was spoilt for many by some rather silly

Virgin Publishing venture, which at the loss of this licence diverted its
efforts into a stand-alone series based around the character of Benny. During
the Virgin period a company called Big Finish Productions had started producing
a range of audio plays </span><img width=197 height=163

successfully received a license from the BBC to produce original Doctor Who
stories using the previous cast members. With the advent of a new Doctor, BFP

animated adventures, the BBC announced the arrival of a ninth Doctor, played by
Robert E Grant, in a new fully animated, and hopefully to be released on DVD,
web story <i>The Scream of the Shalka</i>, written by Paul Cornell who was also
the creator of Benny. With a rather large amount of media coverage and BBC hype
it was hoped that this would mean the Doctor’s 40th anniversary would see many
more such stories produced.</span></p>

serialised over the Internet, the BBC made the announcement that Doctor Who
would return to TV in 2005. The show is now produced by BBC Wales under the
watchful eyes of Russell T. Davies, a previous writer of Doctor Who novels and
the creator of both <i>Queer as Folk</i> and <i>The Second Coming</i>. </span></p>

font-family:Arial;color:black'>The ninth Doctor is played by Christopher Eccleston,
who has worked with Davies on previous projects (including <i>The Second Coming
</i>where he played the son of God) who has a reputation for playing serious
and intense parts but has adopted a lighter ‘comic’ side for the Doctor, which
is readily dropped for serious angst when the situation turns grim. Then new
Doctor comes with a new look, and in the case of this series at least that
means a leather jacket and cropped hair – well why not.  Ironically after the
earlier ratings battle with </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

Rose Tyler, played by singer turned actress Billie Piper. Rose is said to be
more independent than previous female assistants, but then to be honest we have
had this said about Sarah, Leela and Ace, as well as more his equal, something
also said about Romana – we shall just have to wait and see though so far she
is living up to this saving the Doctor and the Earth in <i>Rose</i> and showing
for the first time a real appreciation as to what happens when a person from
contemporary London is exposed to the Doctor’s hectic lifestyle – culture shock
is only the start of it.</span></p>

basic layout (and a return of the roundels) it has a much more organic feel;
suggesting that perhaps in the time since the TVM it has been through a lot and
its evolution has been eclectic in the extreme.  Other special effects are
looking good; and they are in the hands of both Mike Tucker and Oscar (for
Gladiator) winning effects house <i>The Mill</i>.</span></p>

the end of the season. Meanwhile I invite you all to post comments in the
forum. However the media build up has been quite spectacular with generally
rave reviews of preview screenings and it seems every body is keen to mention
the Doctor. Certainly the BBC have been screening trailers and have dedicated a
page in the <i>Radio Times</i> to the show, plus a fold out <i>RT</i> cover and
pull out booklet for the launch edition; there are also bill board posters too!
There have been spots on chat shows (Parkinson on ITV1 and Friday Night with
Jonathon Ross on BBC 1), coverage on <i>Blue Peter</i> (which has also
showcased the transformation of a compost bin into a Dalek by a pair of young
viewers who were presented with their <i>Blue Peter</i> badges by Eccleston </span><img

badge to destroy the ‘Dalek’) and the official bbci website was completely
revamped, it included a real time countdown until the transmission of the first
new episode and now features a themed splash page leading up to each new
episode with behind the scenes articles and clips after the event. There is
also a companion show <i>Doctor Who Confidential</i> shown immediately after
each episode on BBC 3. This half hour show looks at both behind the scenes and
onscreen factors, often relating to the episode in some way, The BBC has also
announced that the series (though not <i>Confidential</i> though this can be
viewed via the website) will debut on DVD in May in an economy format of
episodes only and in November as a complete series TARDIS shaped box set with
additional extras.</span></p>

ITV1’s popular <i>Ant &amp; Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway </i>(a show where the
former child actors/singing duo host a series of ‘challenges’, ‘pranks’, guest
spots and a chance for someone to win the items advertised during the commercial
breaks) which had been rescheduled to start at 7:00pm and had been extensively
promoted as including an interview with David Beckham (former star of
Manchester United FC, captain of the England football team and husband to
former ‘Posh Spice’ Victoria). Initial ratings indicate that <i>Rose</i>
trounced its opposition gaining a peak of 10.6 million viewers and approx 43%
of the viewing figures (Ant &amp; Dec achieved 7.9 million) so far this lead
has been maintained, though figures did drop off for the second episode (though
still remaining respectable), indeed the April 9<sup>th</sup> screened <i>The
Unquiet Dead</i> was the most watched show that Saturday, beating even the
wedding of Prince Charles to Camilla (now Duchess of Cornwall).</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>So he is but there have been many changes. The TARDIS
is now radically different, the internal doors now match the external ‘Police
Box’ doors, in a style borrowed from the Peter Chushing feature films, while
this seems a little insecure and perhaps even ‘tacky’ it does allow for a
number of wonderful shots where the TARDIS doors are open and the console room
is visible – shots that are achievable without costly special effects due to
the external doors being built into the standing TARDIS console room set. The
biggest change in the interior of the TARDIS is probably the console itself. No
longer composed of hard lines the now comprises an essentially round structure
of illuminated blue ‘glass’ with the traditional hexagonal structure being
supplied by six struts that form both the base of the console and the divisions
on the console itself. The Time Rotor is once more linked to the ceiling as in
the TVM and there are again supports forming arch-like structures although
unlike the TVM they appear organic rather than mechanical. The evolution of the
TARDIS is discussed further in its own section. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Between the events of the TVM and the appearance of the
ninth Doctor it seems there have been major changes in the universe at large.
It has been revealed that there was a major conflict, the Time War, which has </span><img
width=157 height=152 src="drwho_files/image022.jpg" align=left hspace=4><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>resulted in the destruction of
planets and races. One of the casualties was the Doctor’s homeworld of
Gallifrey which we are told was reduced to a cinder leaving the Doctor as the
last living Time Lord. It seems likely that this war was the cause of the
Doctor’s recent regeneration, as it has been stated that he took part in this
war. The Doctor’s current outward persona of the ‘northern laddish clown’ seems
to be a cover, and perhaps an escape from, for his more serious and guilt
ridden self. Indeed the Doctor now seems willing to take wild risks in an
effort, perhaps, to atone for his failures in the war; this has rendered him an
easy target for emotional manipulation –as the Gelft ably demonstrated in <i>The
Unquiet Dead.</i> Just who destroyed Gallifrey, and who actually won the war
have yet to be revealed…</span></p>

12.0pt;font-family:Arial'> In what could undoubtedly be termed a shock
announcement (hey, even <i>he</i> wasn’t prepared for it – the BBC let it out
in error when they confirmed the series’ renewal for 2006) Christopher Eccleston
will only be the Doctor for the one 2005 season.  The current season ends with
a two-parter, the mysterious and so far unnamed 12<sup>th</sup> episode and
the, now it seems, rather aptly titled 13<sup>th</sup> <i>The Parting of the
Ways. </i>There will however be a Christmas Special and it is here that the
tenth Doctor will make his debut. The new Doctor has now been confirmed as
David Tennant, who recently came to the public’s attention as the young
Casanova, in the three part series also by Russell T Davies. No details are yet
available regarding the look of the tenth Doctor, but it has been confirmed
that Billie Piper will continue as Rose. In many ways it seems fitting that the
ninth Doctor, who in his first episode turned down the sexual advances of
Rose’s mother should be replaced by an actor currently famed for his portrayal
of the world’s greatest lover! </span></p>

ever so accurate newspapers and interviews with, loose lipped, cast members in
genre publications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The 12<sup>th</sup> and mysteriously anonymous penultimate
episode will probably feature a Dalek invasion of the Earth, probably in Rose’s
home time period as I believe Mickey will be involved, though it may simply
mean that the story includes a visit or even concludes back at her home.  The Daleks
may be the new improved model as seen in the 6<sup>th</sup> episode <i>Dalek</i>,
but could be a new updated and more frightening model – please note that as far
as I am concerned the traditional Daleks <i>are</i> scary when they are handled
properly as a comparison between the classic 60’s episodes and the latter
appearances in the 70’s/80’s indicates. I presume the title of the 12<sup>th</sup>
episode will include the word ‘Dalek’ as it is being kept blank to avoid
spoiling the surprise, however it could just as easily include ‘Cybermen’ or ‘Walford’
as they would be just as surprising. It is likely that the Doctor will
sacrifice himself to save Rose and that at the end of <i>The Parting of the
Ways</i> begins the regeneration, or at least is put into a regeneration
instigating situation – it is unlikely in my opinion that the regeneration will
take place during the Christmas Special (hmmm perhaps in the interest of
political correctness I should refer to it as the <i>Winterfest </i>Special,
but then as I as a Pagan don’t have a problem saying ‘Christmas’ I don’t see
why others should!!) as it has been stated that Eccleston is here for the one
series only and with its given title it would seem that someone leaves or at
least passes in this episodes – though maybe it just means that Rose says
goodbye to Mickey (perhaps he runs of with a Thal?). Only time, as they say,
will tell…</span></p>
