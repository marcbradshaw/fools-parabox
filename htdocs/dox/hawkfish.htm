What makes the stories of Hawk and Fisher different is that while they are cops
(well sergeants in the City Guard), rather than science and guns you have sorcery
and swords. You see the world created by author Simon R Green, inhabited by
Hawk and Fisher is one where magic (of the flash bang whiz type) works and
criminals are just as likely to be demons as they are people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=75 height=122 src="hawkfish_files/image003.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Set in the
sprawling city-state of Haven, Hawk and his wife Isabel Fisher are sergeants in
the City Guard. Unlike the majority of guardsmen, both Hawk and Fisher are
honest; they believe in the law and are not for sale. This means that while
they are very good at their job, they are not the most popular of people,
except by the honest population, who are at least rumoured to exist somewhere,
in Haven. Fisher is unusual in that as well as being a woman; she is also the
best sword wielder in the city. Her husband, Hawk however prefers to rely on
his axe, as due to circumstances that are revealed in one of the books (read
them coz I aint saying) he has lost an eye. Neither of them are particularly
happy to rely on magic, and would much rather grab their suspect by the collar
and ask them to confess, and if the suspect just happens to be a demon or even
a god, well that makes no difference to the law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=75 height=118 src="hawkfish_files/image004.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The tale of Hawk
and Fisher currently spreads over four books, two of which are collections of
stories. It is these short stories that comprise the majority of our heroes’
legend, but things change dramatically in the, so far, final book – Beyond the
Blue Moon. The chronological sequence to read the books is:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Blue Moon Rising
(novel)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Haven of Lost
Souls (collection)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Fear and
Loathing in Haven (collection)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Beyond the
Blue Moon (novel)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=75 height=120 src="hawkfish_files/image005.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>However I think
the best way to read them is the way that I read them, that is to read the two
collections first then Blue Moon Rising and finally Beyond the Blue Moon. I say
this because Blue Moon Rising, while crucial to the story of Hawk and Fisher
(and I won’t spoil things by saying why) sees very little of either sergeant,
while Beyond the Blue Moon is both a sequel to Blue Moon Rising and also ties
up the Haven stories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>So what makes
Hawk and Fisher such a good read? Simply the way that both characters are
portrayed, and of course, the unusual idea of combining High Fantasy with hard
boiled cops. Of course nowadays this idea is also being explored in the Discworld
series, but still Hawk and Fisher have a place of honour on my bookshelf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=75 height=120 src="hawkfish_files/image006.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>One point of
caution</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>, </span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>at least some of the collected stories
are available, or have been available separately and to add even further
confusion to the mix, the US titles of both the collections and the short
stories have been known to vary. It is so confusing that a certain well know
online bookstore has been offering a set of two books (you know the procedure:
buy this one and that one both for £££) except on checking it turns out both
books are the same; one is the UK original and the other the US reprint, its
just the titles that are different (yes even the covers are the same). In the
words of Homer J Simpson; “D’oh!”</span></p>
