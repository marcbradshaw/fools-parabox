<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#FFCC00'>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<a

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:#FFCC00'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Death: an
exploration</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:#FFCC00'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>So what happens when your
time is up and you breath your last? I have been considering my mortality and
find that I have many theories but few definites.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>First I suppose I should
define what life is before I think about what happens when its over. As I
believe that all things are alive this might be trickier than I first thought.
For me, all things in Nature are alive; it is just that some things move around
more. What makes something alive is not limited to whether it has respiration
or the ability to reproduce but whether that thing has within it a node of the
all encompassing Divine Spirit. It is this spirit that gives life to and links
all things together. It is also this spirit that defines what each 'thing' is.
In a similar vein I also feel that some 'unnatural' (made) things gain a node
of defining spirit through either their use or their crafting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>So that is how I define
something as 'alive', now what happens when you pop your clogs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Well my mum's view on death
is that we are like a tin of beans; when the beans are gone, the tin is on the
rubbish heap! ln many ways l can go along with this as I feel that once you die
your defining spirit leaves behind what is now an empty container. The question
is; what happens to the beans?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The first thing to get
straight is that I feel death is more a change than an ending. Just as your
flesh and blood will recycle into Nature, unless someone preserves your remains
or keeps your ashes in an urn on the mantel, so too will your spirit. It is
just what happens to your spirit, the bit that was 'you', that I will try to
address here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The first and easy option
would be to take the 'can of beans' analogy to its limit and say that your
spirit is just absorbed back into the Divine. I, though, think this is far too
simple and feel it would be only likely in the passing of a simple or weak
personality. In the case of a more complex spirit I feel some kind of
progression is more probable. This could take the form of rebirth, translation
or evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Rebirth is quite easy to
rationalise as each new life created would be a void ready to suck in the
nearest spiritual pattern freshly liberated from the body of one who has passed
on. But if it were so simple then why are children not born with the sum
knowledge of their past lives?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Perhaps if we were to
examine the structure of the spiritual construct, which forms, for ease of
understanding, what may be termed a 'soul', we would find a complex pattern of
spiritual energy that is largely held together by the material shell it
inhabits? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>If we therefore accept that
the soul not only defines its body but is also shaped by it in turn, we can see
that once free of its physical restraints its structure might begin to unravel
so that the spirit that reincarnates may not be quite the same as before and
once housed in its new body it would be subject to further remoulding by its
new environment. As the 'new' individual grows then the pattern of its soul is
rewoven to suit. That some may attest to recall their past lives might signify
that some patterns have reformed or that the web of the Divine transcends the
boundary of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>So your soul may in part or
as a whole pass into a new body or may completely unravel and be absorbed back
into the greater Divine. Perhaps the key to the survival of a soul is due to
the complexity, development and strength of self? A complex and well developed
personality with a strong grasp of 'self' is more likely to persist within the
matrix of the disembodied spirit and is therefore much more likely to maintain
some degree of integrity. Now what would happen if at the point of death the
strength of self were so strong that a soul was able to remain intact?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>It is my opinion that any
soul retaining its individuality after death would have only two avenues
available to it: to pass to another 'plane' or to remain and evolve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Do we accept that there are
other planes of existence or levels of reality outside of our limited sphere of
perception? There is no tangible proof, but there are indications within myth
and theology not to mention anecdotal accounts from those who claim personal
experience. So if we take this as fact, it is not beyond reason that the Divine
Spirit permeates these other realms too, and that being the case the ability of
souls to translate to other planes seems most reasonable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Such 'extra perceptual'
realms may not be bound by the physics that define our mundane world, but
perhaps a soul entering such an environment would still experience it in
familiar terms. If this were to imply that such domains are in turn shaped by
the cultural mindsets of migrant souls, then perhaps we would truly find our
Summerland. </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Valhalla</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> and Elysium Fields. Maybe a Heaven and a Hell too! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>If a soul retains its
pre-death personality and hovers around 'old haunts', would you call it a
ghost?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Whether an autonomic soul
passes to another plane or continues to dwell on this the chances are that
sooner or later it will have to change. This change could be a gradual
degradation of integrity leading to eventual re-absorption or it could be
evolution. A soul that grows into a self-contained spiritual entity and spends
its time travelling throughout the various planes of existence must surely gain
in knowledge and, one would hope, wisdom. With unlimited time could not the
soul of a lowly human metamorphose into an entity we might interpret as a god?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Interestingly this also
suggests a motive behind the relationships that some gods have with humanity.
Imagine having a near infinite lifespan, even with access to multiple levels of
existence and an unparalleled understanding of the Divine at some stage boredom
must set in. In some circles it is proposed that a god needs worshippers in
order to survive; the implication being that without worship gods fade. I
suggest however that gods engage in a relationship with ephemeral beings such
as us not to prolong their lives but instead to give their own existence some
purpose. As usual the gods make no comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>So in conclusion it is my
belief that at death, though our bodies may return to the earth, our spirits
face a future that while not certain in direction is certainly not an end. Does
this mean we should not grieve the passing of a loved one? Of course not but
while we mourn our loss we should also celebrate their past life and continued
journey.</span></p>
