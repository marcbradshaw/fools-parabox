<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Towards the end
of the fourth, and possibly final, season plans were made to produce a number
of stand alone TV movies. The first of these was designed to detail both the
Earth-Minbari war and the back story of the main cast, while the second was a
largely self contained story set during the period between the end of the
Shadow war and the liberation of Earth. Because these were shot during the
fourth season the character of Ivanova is featured. The third movie was again
self contained and set after the fifth and final season. Consequently it
featured Captain Lochley, Zack Allan and Lt Corwin with only a visiting
Garibaldi from the original cast. The final two movies were designed as pilots
for potential new series. However only <i>A Call to Arms</i> was successful
(unlike the series it spawned) with the <i>Legend of the Rangers</i> destined
to be a one shot. There was a proposed cinema movie, <i>The Memory of Shadows</i>,
but despite much excitement within the B5 community the deal collapsed. This
movie was to have featured the character of Galen, the resident technomage from
<i>Crusade</i>, who was investigating the distribution and use of Shadow
technology. This was expected to have been a part of the ongoing development of
the <i>Crusade</i> series, but it looks like again the story has been stalled.</span></p>

he is now emperor and can make a command. The children want a true story, so

out more about the Minbari, who have until now remained secluded. Asking the
Centauri representative (Londo) about the Minbari, results in the good advice
of letting sleeping dogs lie. Undeterred the mission to investigate the Minbari
is offered to up and coming officer, John Sheridan, but he prefers to remain

Minbar, Lennon, the leader of the now diminished and old Rangers is taken
before the Grey Council in their battle cruiser. He states his case that the
Rangers need new blood, but is rebuffed by the representatives of the Military
Caste. Dukhat, the leader of the council agrees to take the ship to investigate
activities on the Rim, but that they would do so via a circuitous route. Newly
elected to the council, Delenn, questions Dukhat, who is also her mentor, but
he is reluctant to answer her. Pointing out that recent cargoes indicate a
visit by beings requiring a different atmosphere, Delenn is not easily put off
the scent. </span></p>

and equality. Dukhat realises that this may be seen as a threat but before he
can take action the Earth ship opens fire. The initial attack wrecks much havoc
and kills a number of councillors, including Dukhat. Delenn is asked what to
do, and overcome by grief gives the order to kill all humans. She later goes
into Dukhat’s quarters and finds it occupied by a Vorlon. The Vorlon tells her
that they will encounter a new race and must join them as allies; this race is
the humans.</span></p>

they built a portal into a higher dimension. Lyta explains that the Vorlons
opened the portal but found a race older than them, all telepathic and
determined to kill all life other than them. The aliens had modified the gate
to amplify their telepathy and they took control of some of the Vorlons
themselves. The Vorlons tried to destroy the gate but those under alien control

Garibaldi has been overseeing the construction of two prototype heavy cruisers

They are really sharing a transmission from a probe that Galen has on this

  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span style='font-family:

are no more powerful than the existing battle fleet. Garibaldi explains that
there is a second system, but there is a problem. Because the weapons they have
developed are from technologies with much greater power resources the main guns
while packing a tremendous punch, drain the ship of virtually all power. Once
fired the ship is crippled for 60 seconds, so they can only be used as a last
resort.&nbsp; When they go to test fire, </span><span style='font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>On B5 Dureena
Nafeel is stopped at immigration as she is carrying weapons. She dutifully
hands them over; Zack is surprised that so many could be hidden on one person.
She is from a race unknown to anyone and asks where people go if they are
‘lost’. Zack directs her to Down Below. Dureena is looking for hidden markers
and follows them to a hatch, as she climbs through she is knocked unconscious.
Dureena is on the same planet that </span><span style='font-family:Arial;

on, she is seriously spooked. </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sheridan</span><span

Dureena recovers; she is in chains before the Thieves’ Guild. She is questioned
and shrugging of the chains shows them a tattoo that marks her as a member.</span></p>

the Shadows as he did not come to their aid. </span><span style='font-family:

explains that the coalition did not receive the mayday until too late, but even

Recovering a data crystal from him they find that he arrived too late and
followed the ships who attacked the planet and then returned hoping they did
not see him. Four ships appear but they do not recognise the prototypes. </span><span

style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> and the Victory head back to Earth, over
taking the slower attack fleet. They are met by a mass fleet of ships alerted

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>A violent battle
ensues when the Drakh arrive. Captain Anderson destroys the planet killer by
ramming the Victory directly into the control node. With the planet killer is
destroyed but at great cost, unfortunately the Drakh have a second plan; a
fleet of Drakh ships has slipped past the fleet and begins seeding Earth’s atmosphere
with a black powder. Analysis shows the Drakh have infected the Earth with a
plague. The plague is another Shadow weapon, but because the Drakh have not had
time to tailor it to human DNA it will take approximately five years to adapt
and kill all life on the planet. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Earth is now
in quarantine and the Excalibur will be equipped as a research ship; it will
follow up leads found by the Rangers across the galaxy. It is hoped that
somewhere in the past the Shadows will have used the plague, and their victims
will have found away to counter it.</span></p>
