<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Wicca is
perhaps the largest and best known of the modern Pagan paths;</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> it is also one of the most
misrepresented. Many people see Wicca a modern form of witchcraft, while that
may be true in some ways it is not a direct evolution of traditional witchcraft
and neither is it the only form of witchcraft practiced today. Indeed Wicca is
not even a single path in itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Many labour
under the impression that Wicca is simply a renaming of classic witchcraft, and
that all witches, including those that were persecuted during the witch trials
(or the ‘Burning Times’ as they are often so emotively described), are Wiccan;
in truth these assumptions are untrue. Wicca is in fact a recent movement,
founded no earlier than the mid twentieth century, and it has a very mixed
pedigree. Wicca was first revealed to the general public in a novel <i>High
Magic’s Aid</i> written by retired civil servant and returned colonialist
Gerald Brosseau Gardner (1884-1964). This book was published in the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>UK</span><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'> in 1949, prior to the repeal of the Witchcraft Act (1951), hence
its position as a work of fiction. Once the act had been repealed </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> published Witchcraft Today (1954), and set out the basis of
the Wiccan faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=113 height=174 src="wicca_files/image001.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>So if Wicca is
not ancient witchcraft what exactly is it? Gardner remains a man of much
mystery despite the efforts of many to chronicle his life, but  whatever the
truth, he claimed to have been initiated into a New Forrest coven in 1939,
possibly by one Dorothy Clutterbuck but maybe by a lady known as ‘Dafo’, and he
certainly new many of the leading figures in the pagan and occult society of
the time including Doreen Valiente (who can name The Charge of the Goddess
amongst her contributions to Wicca), Osman Spare and ‘The Beast’ himself Aleister
Crowley. </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> had himself belonged to a number of
occult societies including the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis), Rosicrucian Crotona
Fellowship and a Co-Mason order. During his career </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> had worked in </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Malaysia</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> and
brought back a fascination with knives. Certainly in the creation of Wicca, </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> incorporated the ideals and practices of many of the
societies and philosophies he had experienced as well as, some say, his own
personal peccadilloes of naturism and S&amp;M. How much of the rituals and
practices were solely of </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s own devising is unknown and there are
certainly claims that he collaborated with others, particularly </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Crowley</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> in their construction. However nothing is absolutely
certain, baring the contributions attributed to Valiente, who is said to have
rewritten much of the original material granting it much of its current power
and a degree of continuity. What can be stated with real surety is that on
examination the rituals and beliefs of Wicca owe as much to eastern philosophies/religions,
Masonic traditions, ceremonial magic and occult societies as they do to any
form of classical witchcraft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=129 height=183 src="wicca_files/image002.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Wicca can best
be described then as a fairly modern, though it’s relatively recent genesis is
no reason to doubt its validity, spiritual path that incorporates practices and
ideas from many sources, including those predating Christianity and practiced
as witchcraft, in a structured and integrated manner. Gardner’s original Wicca
included such practices as attending rituals <i>skyclad</i>, the fivefold kiss
and the Great Rite, it was structured around the eight festivals of the, now
traditional, Wheel of the Year (sabbats) and the lunar calendar featuring
rituals on the full moon (esbats). Worship took place in a coven led by a High
Priestess and a High Priest, with members being initiated and progressing
through three degrees, by which time they had earned the right to leave the
coven and found their own group. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>However, as in
all groups and organisations some conflict will arise, and with Wicca this lead
to the formation of different paths and interpretations. The first schism
resulted in the classification of the original as the <i>Gardnerian</i> <i>Tradition</i>
and the new branch, founded by Alex and Maxine Sanders, as the <i>Alexandrian
Tradition</i>. While there may have been some rivalry at first both these
traditions are very similar and based on </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s
original foundations. Over time many more traditions split from the main
groups, often incorporating the personal interpretations of their founders
though still holding to the basics of </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s
design.  Two of the more successful of these new traditions are <i>Saex Wicca</i>
(founded by Raymond Buckland and based loosely on Saxon gods) and <i>Georgian
Wicca</i> (an eclectic path founded by George ‘Pat’ Patterson).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Two things that
often causes conflict within Wiccan circles are the matters of initiation and
lineage. </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> laid down the practice that all members
of a coven are initiated through three degrees, based upon knowledge and
experience, with the final degree giving the right for the initiate to leave
the circle and form their own group. Thus all Wiccans had to prove their
abilities and all covens could be traced back to </span><span style='font-family:
  Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s
original. However with the later traditions these two conventions have been
subject to much reinterpretation. Many traditions are now arising spontaneously
based on the growth in books purporting to teach you everything you need to
know to become a witch (of a Wiccan variety at any rate). As a result many
people now perform self initiation and as such any covens they form will have
no direct link back to </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>. Furthermore, many new Wiccans do not
even join a group, either because they are unable to find a coven or simply
because they wish to remain solitary. Many will argue that if a group can not
trace its lineage then it is not valid, or if someone is self initiated they
are not a true Wiccan.  While some will differentiate between the two as Wicca
for the ‘recognised’ traditions and wicca or neo-wicca for the self
initiated/spontaneous groups. Personally as far as I am concerned if you follow
the basics of Wicca with honesty and with serious intent, you are just as
entitled to use the term to describe your path. However I do agree with the
initiated and lineaged groups that you should not make claims to which you have
no right. So while I am more than happy to accept any Wiccan as a Wiccan, if
they make claims to lineage, history, authority or experience that they have no
right to I feel that they dishonour both themselves and their path/groups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>So if there are
so many different interpretations of Wicca out there now, how do you recognise
Wicca from the other Pagan paths and practices? Well simply put Wicca has some
very basic concepts and practices which are largely in common:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Deities
     are aspects of a single divine force, often split into a God (Horned) and
     Goddess (Lunar Mother) who may be called by any name drawn from the
     world’s many faiths.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Nature
     is sacred.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Rituals
     are set by the change of seasons (forming the Wheel of the Year) and
     solar/lunar phases.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Magic
     if practiced is ritualistic.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>A
     number of tools and props are used, including an athame, boline, scourge,
     pentacle, candles, wand, sword, chalice, incense, crystals, besom etc..</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Rituals
     take place in an area of sacred space created by casting a circle and
     invoking the elemental guardians.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Rituals
     usually include a sharing of ‘cakes and ale’</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-family:Arial'>At
     death you pass to the Summerlands to rest before possible reincarnation.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The two most
important ideals are:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Law of Threefold
Return – basically a reworking of karmic debt, it states that whatever you do
comes back to you, either in this life or the next, three times over. Therefore
cause someone harm and you get the same harm back three times over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The Wiccan Rede
– probably the only piece of doctrine within Wicca, in its simplest form the rede
states:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>An it harm none, do as you wilt</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=115 height=175 src="wicca_files/image003.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>This basically
means that providing you cause no harm to others you should act as you think
best. This is often confused with </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Crowley</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>’s
statement:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Do as you will is the whole of the law.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Will under love.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Love is the law.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Though whether
this indicates </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Crowley</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> was influenced by </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> or </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> by </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Crowley</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>
no-one can really say, a lot depends on when </span><span style='font-family:
  Arial;color:black'>Gardner</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>
and </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Crowley</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> actually met, something that like much
of Wicca is subject to conflicting opinion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>One thing that
must be made clear though is that while some may claim that Wiccans have to be
initiated and others that self initiation can be made, no matter what the route
becoming a Wiccan it is not something that happens overnight. While book
learning may be enough to start the process, the ability to question what is
offered and the knowledge gained by experience are the two things that will
cement the title.</span></p>
