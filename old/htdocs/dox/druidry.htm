align=right hspace=4><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Druids were
the spiritual core of the Celtic tribes</span></b><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> <b>that populated pre-Roman Europe</b>. The Druids were
very powerful and very important to the Celtic people; something which marked
them as a threat to Roman imperialism. Simply put the Druids were the glue that
kept the tribes together, so the Romans massacred the Druids and destroyed
their places of worship in a concerted effort to shatter their power.
Inevitably the Romans succeeded and as the majority of Druid ritual and history
was passed down orally, much of their culture, belief system and ritual
practice is lost to time. The only real accounts we have left are those handed
down by people like Julius Caesar and the Christian scholars that followed, of
course it must be remembered that any such records are at best described as
from an uninformed point of view and at worse as subject to prejudicial spin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>What we do know is
that the Druids power was centred on the Ynys Mon/Mona’s Isle, which is modern
day Anglesey, and that Druids worshiped a nature based religion usually in
forest groves, they considered the oak tree as sacred (Druid is derived from
the Celtic ‘duir’ which means oak) and they harvested mistletoe from trees
using a golden sickle. There is also talk of sacrifice, both animal and human
often using the dreaded wicker man (a wooden cage – often in human form- which
was filled with the living sacrifices and then burnt). However a few things
must be born in mind here; the accounts are, as noted above, unverifiable, the
Celts are thought to believe that death was simply a journey to another realm
and it is also possible that the sacrifices were dressed dummies (no,
honestly). Even if the tales of blood shed are true – why the stigma? Most
early religions spilt there own share of blood, as a read of the Bible will
testify.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>So the Druids
died out during the Roman occupation – more or less, some will probably have
survived, going underground, as some Druids were often mobile travelling
between tribes or perhaps even converting to Christianity. Regardless of any
survivors the era of the Druid had passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The Revival</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=200 height=152 src="druidry_files/image002.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Druidry was
first revived in the eighteenth century, however these Druids were nothing like
the originals, instead they were often organised along the lines of the
Freemasons and in some cases had no religious aspects at all. However modern
Druids (or neo-Druids if you want) are a different kettle of acorns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Modern Druidry
is a reconstructed path that seeks to integrate what is known about the old
ways, whether actually true or theorised, with modern spirituality and draws
upon the myths of the Celts, particularly the Welsh <i>Mabinogion</i> and the
Irish <i>Book of Tain</i>, and the Arthurian cycle, though more often the
Breton version rather than the Romance version that most people are familiar
with today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Beliefs</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Central to
modern Druid belief is the concept of <i>Awen</i>, an all pervading life force,
though different Druid groups may interpret this in different ways. Basically
it is seen as the creative force, the life force that is everywhere. Many
Druids see this as an unknowable force that is the source of all religions and
that all faiths have their own name and view of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Druids tend to celebrate festivals roughly equivalent with the
Wiccan Wheel of the Year, though some observe a calendar based on a pre 1752 CE
system and thus dates of the fire festivals (Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane and
Lughnasadh) may vary by eleven days. The other festivals are the solar
festivals and as such fall on the same dates as celebrated by other paths.</span></p>

color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>The Druidry system is one of structure and progression and commonly
consists of three grades: Bards, Ovates, and Druids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>The role of Bard is concerned with the learning, performing and
composing the stories, songs and poems that are part of Druid culture</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>The role of Ovate is deals with medicine, herbs, botany, astronomy
and astrology. They are also seen as taking a more shamanistic role.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Druids as the third grade combine the experience and resources of
a Bard and Ovate to become teachers, priest and advisers. You could say that
when reaching the grade of Druid you are blending the two spheres of material
and spiritual to create a greater role; it is easy therefore to see why the
ancient Druids were so well respected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:#F6F9A0'><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'>While I have stated that Druidry was an oral tradition, forms of
writing were developed. The most common of these is Ogham (pronounced oh-am)
which was produced by scoring a line across the edge of a piece of wood or
stone. There are a couple of different styles of Ogham in use today by reconstructionists
and there is also a ‘rune’ like Bardic script called the <i>coelbren</i> when
cut into wood, or the <i>coelvain</i> when cut into stone.</span></p>
