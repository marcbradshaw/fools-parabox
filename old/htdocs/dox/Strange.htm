align=right hspace=4><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Strange was
a show that promised much</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>,
and to be honest did a good job of delivering. Unfortunately the BBC didn’t
think so and it failed to win a second season. Touted as a British X Files,
Strange was the story of Jonathon Strange (Richard Coyle), a defrocked priest
turned demon hunter. During the pilot Strange’s investigations into the death
of a priest bring him into contact with Jude (Samantha Janus) a nurse at the
local hospital who had treated the priest before he had died. Coincidently
Rich, Jude’s partner and a motorcycle courier, had previously had a delivery
for Strange, but when he tried to deliver at the given address, at the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Church</span><span style='font-family:
 Arial;color:black'> of </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>St
  Vincent</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>, the curate Doddington
(Samuel Barnet) in residence denies any knowledge of Strange’s existence.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'><img width=200 height=25
src="Strange_files/image002.gif"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Turning to
leave, the packages was snatched from his hands by a downs syndrome boy, Kevin
(Timmy Lang), who happens to work as a gardener for the Canon, and  who leads
Rich on a chase which ended at an old house with bricked windows – the home of
Jonathon Strange. The package had contained an old book, which we discover the
old priest was trying to translate for Strange. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=131 height=124 src="Strange_files/image003.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Drawn deeper
into Strange’s world, Jude, who used to be a physicist before she had Joey, her
child by Rich, is not sure whether Strange is insane, as the Canon would have
her believe, or if in fact there really are such things as demons. Inside the
dark rooms (Strange can not afford much in the way of electricity bills) of Strange’s
home, Jude is introduced to Toby (Andrew Lee-Potts in the series) , a gifted
hacker and demon hunter, and shown banks of instruments that Strange uses along
with a network of sensitives, including Kevin, to monitor for demonic activity.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=129 height=121 src="Strange_files/image004.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>As the story
develops concerns are raised over Joey who seems to be missing each time there
is another death, and Canon Black (Ian Richardson), who seems to be covering up
all the evidence that could confirm Strange’s theories. The demon is confirmed
as being composed of electricity (living lightning, so to speak) and coming
from a secret crypt beneath a Church; the same church where the dead priest was
stationed, and also where Joey has been sneaking to each night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Finally it is
revealed that the demon has been around for centuries prompting man’s
development of electricity, and there in a picture of Faraday is the demon in
its human form: Rich.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>A dramatic
showdown in the crypt results in Rich’s destruction but Jude is left wondering 
whether Joey has inherited his father’s demonic nature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The pilot
garnered figures of over 5 million viewers, impressive as there had been
virtually no promotion, and this resulted in the commissioning of a further six
episodes. This is where Auntie fumbled the ball. The gap between the pilot and
the series was over a year, long enough for people to forget the details, and
so a sensible idea would have been to repeat the pilot to lead in to the new
series and to back the whole thing up with some heavy trails. Well we got some
trails but the pilot was not repeated. As a result those who had seen the pilot
were left trying to remember the premise and those that hadn’t were left
dumfounded. A repeat would have helped as an underlying theme of the first
story was whether Joey was a demon. At one point while he is being secretly
checked over by a sensitive, Joey is seen playing with a GameBoy Advance with
interestingly an illuminated screen….</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=133 height=133 src="Strange_files/image005.jpg"
align=left hspace=4 vspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>As it
happened though the series did work and during the next 5 episodes we were
treated to stories centred around a death coach and a demon child, a demonic
bus, a Romanian vampire (and boy did that have a twist), demonic tattoos and demonspawn
being incubated in breast implants. During the first five stories clues were
scattered concerning the events that pushed Strange into his nervous breakdown
and resulted in the death of his fiancé and his expulsion from the Church.
Furthermore hints were dropped over the motives of Canon Black who was actively
working to undermine Strange’s investigations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The final story
revealed how Strange’s fiancé was killed by a demon, Asmoth, and one that was
still at large as Strange had been unable to kill it. Now there were events
that indicated that the demon is active once more and while Strange is
beginning to act rashly due to his past failure, Black is working to once more
conceal the evidence. With the police now involved and on the trail of Strange,
thanks to Black’s meddling. Jude discovers who is behind the recent grizzly
discoveries unfortunately it turns out not to be a demon, but rather a mentally
unstable man with a craving for human flesh. Meanwhile Strange has been set up
by Black and caught with some human remains; he is arrested and while in his
cell is treated to some mocking messages appearing on the ceiling in fiery
writing, unknown to him Black is outside talking to the detective. Jude on the
trail of the faux demon stumbles onto his lair and is trapped, locked into a
locker, but as the madman prepares to kill her, Joey rushes in and in a demonic
voice tells him to leave his mother alone, while shooting lightning from his
hands. Back in the hospital Jude comforts Joey, who has no memory of his
demonic outburst, when the police rush in with Strange who has been severely
beaten and is comatose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=133 height=100 src="Strange_files/image006.jpg"
align=right hspace=4 vspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The
series ends with Strange comatose and no answers. There could easily have been
a second series here. We now know that Joey is at least part demon, something
that might cause friction later on. We know that the demon, Asmoth, behind the
death of Strange’s fiancé is probably still out there. We have big suspicions
over Black’s motives, perhaps over his humanity as well. </span></p>
