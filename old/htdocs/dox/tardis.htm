align=right hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>Perhaps the most surprising thing about a TARDIS is that it’s
inside and outside, although connected, exists in different dimensions. The
outer shell is designed to change form so that it blends in with the local
environment, thus a Time Lord could arrive on a planet without fear of
discovery. Even if a TARDIS was located, the outer shell is both virtually
indestructible and protected by a powerful force field; Time Lords are a
cautious race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=154 height=138 src="tardis_files/image002.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
interior of a TARDIS is large, very large, and can be reconfigured to suit its
owner's whims, though if left to its own devices tends to favour pale
grey-white with roundel covered walls, at least in the case of the Doctor's
ship.  A TARDIS travels by dematerialising its outer shell from one place and
moving it through the time-space vortex to a new location where it
rematerializes. The arrival, and departure, of a TARDIS is usually accompanied
by much wheezing and groaning, as its engines move it across dimensional
boundaries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>Each TARDIS draws its power from the Eye of Harmony, a black hole
engineered by the legendry Omega and harnessed by the founder of Time Lord
Society Rassilon, located at the core of the Time Lord home world, Gallifrey.
The console room houses a hexagonal control unit with a column at its centre,
the time rotor, which moves up and down when in flight. It is not uncommon to
configure supplementary console rooms, possibly as a safety measure, with the
main doors routed to whichever one is in use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>A TARDIS possesses a sufficiently developed intelligence to be
regarded as at least partially sentient and develops a beneficent symbiotic
relationship with its crew which via its telepathic circuits is thought to
assist in allowing them to communicate in an extended range of languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=178 height=147 src="tardis_files/image003.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>As noted at the beginning of this article, the Time Lords designed
their ships to change their external form to match in with the local
surroundings. Whether the TARDIS would ‘look around’ and choose a suitable form
on arrival or if it would have to be manually reconfigured has never been made
clear. Certainly when the Doctor noticed the TARDIS had not changed form, his
manner suggested it should have changed, however we have seen the Master’s
TARDIS change form after arrival, and it seems that on at least some occasions
the form was pre-chosen. My guess is that the option is there for either
method.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>However if that is the case, why does the Doctor’s TARDIS look
like it does? The </span><img width=163 height=157

12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Doctor is believed to have left Gallifrey
under less than ideal conditions. While he was able to secure the <i>Validium</i>
living metal (used as a defensive weapon, and which would become the Nemesis
statue in <i>Silver Nemesis) </i>and Omega’s Remote Stellar Manipulator (The <i>Hand
of Omega</i>, as coveted by the Daleks in <i>Remembrance of the Daleks</i>) and
also presumably pick up Susan (who certainly believes the Doctor to be her
grandfather and with her knowledge of Gallifrey and minor telepathy is most
likely a bona-fide Gallifreyan, if not a Time Lord (er, Lady) herself), but he
was not able to appropriate a ship through conventional means. As a result the
Doctor ‘acquired’ his TARDIS from the workshop; it was in the process of being
repaired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>Conventional wisdom says that the Doctor stole his TARDIS, however
I wonder if perhaps it was his TARDIS that was under repair – may be it was
being repaired as a ruse to facilitate an easier exit. After all from what we
have seen of Gallifreyan security, TT Capsules (TARDISs) are routinely
monitored and tracked, but if one departed from the workshop would it have
slipped through? Whatever the background, it appears that the Doctor’s TARDIS
probably spent some time parked on the streets of the </span><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>United Kingdom</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> in the first half of
the twentieth century. As a result the TARDIS assumed the form of a Police Box,
the form which it has retained ever since.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>The <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/history/policebox.htm">Police
Box</a> is now, more or less, a forgotten piece of street furniture. Before the
widespread use of personal radios (and of course cell phones today) the only
way to communicate with the Bobby on the beat was to use the Police Box. 
Apparently, and this may be slightly apocryphal, the light on top of the box
would be lit if there was a message, and when an officer saw the light, he
would ring in to the local station for the details. Of course the box also
allowed members of the public to contact the police in case of emergency and it
provided a secure area to store equipment and perhaps the occasional criminal. 
I believe that they also acted as a first aid station and of course I am sure
that more than one crafty copper sheltered from the rain! There however was one
new Police Box built in the 90’s. The Metropolitan Police (of </span><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>London</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>) built a hi-tech
version of a police box, located out side <a
href="http://www.lurs.org.uk/un/tardis.htm">Earl’s Court</a> Tube Station,
including CCT cameras and the expected link to the police for the public. As an
interesting twist, the BBC is now the copyright holder of the appearance of the
Police Box, and so if the police want to make any more, they have to ask Auntie
first……</span></p>

That the TARDIS did not change form at this point may not have aroused any
suspicion as it was still within the same era. Interestingly enough there have
been a few attempts to repair the chameleon circuit, and as a result the TARDIS
has changed form briefly, however it has always returned to the form of the old
blue box; perhaps it finds it comfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>Over the years the Doctor’s TARDIS has evolved. When it first
appeared in <i>An Unearthly Child</i> the console room was seen to be large and
adorned with roundels. The console was hexagonal with a central column that
rose and fell when the ship was in transit and spun slowly on materialisation.
The console was a picture of advanced technology (though of course nothing
dates faster than <i>advanced</i> technology) and it stayed more or less in
this form throughout the 60’s. With the arrival of the third Doctor’s and
colour in the 70’s the TARDIS was initially rarely seen but with the Doctor’s
exile being ended the  TARDIS interior became more common. Again it retained
the basic layout of the hexagonal console, though the central column was now a
little less spectacular (it also no longer rotated on arrival simply retaining
the rise and fall in transit). The wall retained the idea of roundels, though
in a slightly more exaggerated form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=187 height=162 src="tardis_files/image007.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>Moving into the time of the forth Doctor, the console retained its
form, until the disclosure of a second console room complete with wood panelled
walls in season 14. This room had a much smaller and compact, wooden, console
with what sometimes appeared to be a shaving mirror in place of the old central
column. Roundels were present, but in the form of stained glass windows. This
console room was square (a simpler set by far) and featured a definite step
from the doorway to the console itself. This new image was in its own way quite
charming, if a tad low budget, and had a slight air of H.G. Wells about it.
However after relatively few appearances the older white roundel walled
hexagonal console room was restored, just as well as the arrival of K-9 would
have caused problems with the step and doorway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>When the Doctor next returned to Gallifrey, during <i>The Invasion
of Time</i>, much more of the TARDIS interior was required on screen, and due
to, I believe, industrial disputes, an old power station was used to double for
the corridors and a swimming pool for the bathroom. This was a little eccentric
to say the least, however it did establish that the TARDIS interior could be
changed just as the </span><img width=167 height=144
src="tardis_files/image008.jpg" align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>exterior couldn’t. Things settled down
after this with the TARDIS interior remaining more or less unchanged until the
20<sup>th</sup> anniversary year and the unveiling of a new updated, but still
traditional, console. Now when extra rooms were seen on board, they were
complete with roundels, and matched the console room in general appearance. The
corridors too had roundels, and indeed there were in the time of the fifth
Doctor, many scenes showing the many corridors, all looking the same. Two rooms
were however different; the pink toned zero room (later jettisoned) and the
cloister room, which had the appearance of being in a slightly run down and
neglected garden. It was presumably the cloister room which included the
cloister bell, designed to ring at times of extreme danger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>Nothing much changed then until the TVM which totally redesigned
the TARDIS interior. Now the roundels were gone, though a few circular cut-outs
were left on the edge of some of the girders. The new interior was dark, and
large with a library wall, complete with easy chair and reading lamp, a
compartmentalised storage wall, and the new, much smaller console. In many
respects it looked like the TARDIS had been invaded by a selection of teams
from <i>Real Rooms</i> and <i>House Invaders</i>. The new console was still
hexagonal, and it had a central column that rose and fell while in transit,
however the controls were very Wellsian, and the central column was </span><img
width=204 height=187 src="tardis_files/image009.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>connected to the
ceiling. The console itself was located on a raised platform, with enormous
steel arches leading up to the central column which would have made Isembard
Kingdom Brunell extremely happy. In all this console room was very different,
but still retained the general idea of the original. Additional to the console
room was the cloister room which included galleries and stone staircases
arranged around something identified as the <i>Eye of Harmony</i>, which
resembled a stone eye. It is probable that this ‘eye’ was the point that
connected the TARDIS to the ‘eye’ on Gallifrey, but this was never mentioned on
screen. No mention was made about the constant repetition of the <i>Seal of
Rassilon</i>, that adorned virtually every surface – perhaps the TARDIS has
themes like a modern PC, in this case the Doctor had selected one called <i>Rassilon
Steam-Punk</i>!</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>So we finally reach the new series, and a brand new TARDIS
interior. While it has been established in <i>The Unquiet Dead</i> that the
TARDIS still has multiple rooms we have so far seen only the console room, and
very different it is too. The new console room is on several levels, a ramp
leads up from the external doors, which now appear as part of the console room
complete with telephone (in a direct homage to the Peter Cushing films where
the interior of the TARDIS was a tangle of equipment and scientific apparatus
with the reverse of the doors set into a wall), to the raised console area –
handy if K-9 should pop by for a visit, thought the grill that comprises the
floor could cause him problems.  There is also a raised maintenance platform
around the central column, though we haven’t seen this used as yet. The
interior is now dome shaped, resembling the interior of an igloo, with the
walls lined in roundels, which now exist in modular blocks and are set into
darker hexagonal recesses. The roundels are lit. The ceiling of the console
room is semi-translucent and designed to let in light reflecting conditions
outside. Around the edges of the room are six branched struts which both
support the maintenance deck and the ceiling itself. These ‘ribs’ like much of
the new interior appear to be more organic than manufactured. The console
itself is no longer strictly hexagonal, but is now round and constructed of a
translucent and illuminated glass like substance, complete with an uneven,
almost cracked or melted surface. The base of the console is now formed by six
struts that fold round the console, dividing it into panels and forming the
familiar hexagonal form. The struts continue up to the ring at the base of the
central column, which itself disappears into a housing attached to the centre
of the ceiling. The console room in many ways resembles the one from the TVM,
but almost as though it has been grown rather than built.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=207 height=143 src="tardis_files/image010.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
reasoning behind the new design is that during the Time War,  the TARDIS went
through a lot of nasty experiences and as a result it has been forced to
‘regrow’ itself. In addition the Doctor has been forced to effect repairs using
available resources (pram wheel, bicycle pump, chess pieces – all have been
adapted to fit into the jury rigged controls) he has had to sacrifice style for
function – though the functions he puts things to are often vastly different to
their original purpose. Another result of this bodged technology is that the
automatic systems that enabled the Doctor to pilot the TARDIS alone (a crew of
three having been decided upon as the optimum) have been compromised, therefore
while she might get you where you want to go the journey is not exactly smooth.
Its also worth noting that the journey styles have changed: Where previous
Doctors have entered co-ordinates and set the TARDIS in motion, then retired to
games of chess, tinkering with equipment, arguing with Tegan or Peri, indulging
in keep fit or some other hobby, safe in the knowledge that when she gets
there, the ‘old girl’ will materialise and maybe even announce it with a
pleasant chime, now the Doctor has to adopt a hands on approach to the
controls, even roping in Rose to operate some of them, until the destination is
reached. The journey times are therefore thankfully much shorter, albeit more
turbulent, and external observation indicates that rather than spinning through
the vortex from point A to point B the TARDIS now seems to travel through
colour coded (red shifted and blue shifted?) time tunnels that are accessed by
entering real space when a change in temporal or physical direction is
required. Whether this is as a result of the Time War or changes the Doctor has
made to the TARDIS systems has not been revealed. </span></p>
