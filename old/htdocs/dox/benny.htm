style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>: archaeologist, mother,
adventurer, cynic, diarist, wife, ex-wife, possible future wife, soldier,
jailbird and galactic saviour. Not to mention her careers as author, academic
and singer in a 1980's punk band. No wonder she spends so much time indulging
in alcohol therapy!</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Bernice was created by talented author Paul Cornell, for Virgin
Publishing's <i>New Adventures of Doctor Who</i> series of original novels. She
made her debut in the story <i>Love and War</i>, which at the same time as
writing her in to the Doctor's life, also wrote out his existing TV companion,
Ace. For her second story, <i>Transit</i>, Benny spent much of the time
possessed by an alien force intent on talking over human space. Her life cannot
be described as boring!</span></p>

align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>'Professor'
Summerfield was introduced as an archaeologist, born during one of the many Dalek
wars and specialising in 20th Century Earth history. This being handy as the
reader was presumably living in that very same time zone. Benny was also
interested in Martian (Ice Warrior) culture and alcohol, and kept a diary,
where she was of the habit of rewriting unfavourable events by posting sticky
notes over the offending entries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Over time we learnt that despite her genuine knowledge, passion
and skill, Benny's academic qualifications were faked and that she lost both
parents to the Daleks. As a child she had watched her mother die in a Dalek
raid whilst trying to retrieve a doll, dropped en route to the shelter, and her
father was reported to have turned traitor and run with his ship from a Dalek
fleet, though later she found he had in fact </span><img width=137 height=154

12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>diverted to foil a hidden Dalek
counterattack and ended up falling through a time warp.  A forced tenure at an
army school has given Bernice a strong dislike for the military mindset, but
was also probably responsible for developing her own strong will and belief in
the rights of the underdog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>During her travels in the TARDIS Bernice met and married the
temporally displaced Jason Kane. This event took place in the 50th New
Adventure <i>Happy Endings</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>When the BBC decided not to renew Virgin's license for Doctor Who
novels (having after 30 odd years finally realising that Doctor Who books made
money), Virgin decided to drop 'Doctor Who' from the title and let Bernice take
over <i>The New Adventures</i>. Benny therefore has the distinction of being
both the first non-TV companion to accompany the Doctor in his continued
adventures and also the first companion to establish themselves in their own
on-going series. Benny also appeared in the continuing comic strip adventures
of the Doctor in the monthly <i>Doctor Who Magazine</i>, published by Marvel
Comics UK (since bought by Panini).</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Could the series survive the loss of both its central character
and its very raison d'être? Well despite being lumbered with such a pointless
title the books were moderately successful, at least for a while. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=157 height=158 src="benny_files/image005.jpg"
align=left hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>For her tenure as star of <i>The New Adventures</i> Bernice had
both divorced Jason and gained bona fide qualifications before taking up a
position in the faculty of the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
  Arial;color:black'>University</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
 Arial;color:black'> of </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Dellah</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>. Deprived of the rights to BBC owned characters Benny was cut off
from her origins: no Doctor, no Daleks, no Ice Warriors (though describing them
as Martians was OK) and no time travel (at least via TARDIS). However there was
still a small supporting cast owned by their creators if not by Virgin
themselves, and very soon Benny was established.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Unfortunately the series' reprieve was short lived but it was to
go out in a blaze of glory. A story arc was started with the return of the old
gods (no I don’t mean Odin, Zeus and definitely not YHWH) and the fall of Dellah,
which would both bring the universe to the brink of civil war (Time Lords
(though of course not called by name) versus the People versus the gods) and
tie up all the loose ends. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=117 height=177 src="benny_files/image006.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>And so it ended with Jason lost to a hell dimension and Benny
exposed to a burst of rejuvenating energy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>While Benny was still in print Virgin licensed Big Finish
Productions to produce a series of audio dramas adapted from novels in the <i>New
Adventures</i> range and starring the wonderful Lisa Bowerman as Bernice.
Although most of these were chosen from after the end of the BBC license a few
of the earlier stories were rewritten to remove the Doctor and any other such
elements. The audios proved sufficiently successful to persuade BFP to not only
continue the range when they had already launched a regular Doctor Who series,
but also to produce a short lived series of original novels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=179 height=177 src="benny_files/image007.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Benny's
adventures now continue courtesy of BFP as scheduled original audio dramas,
occasional books and the odd guest appearance in Doctor Who audios. Benny now
has a position on the Braxiatel Collection and has recently become a mother to
Peter, though she has not remarried. She shares her quarters with her son,
Joseph (a robot PDA with attitude) and Wolsey her cat. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Recent events at BFP have allowed closer links to be established
with the 'Doctor Who Universe' thus we have seen interaction with both old
friends and foes alike. Most recently the Collection was invaded by the Fifth
Axis (think Nazis in Space) and Bernice and friends had to come to terms with
living under the heel of a fascist state. As racial purity is high on the Axis'
agenda being the mother of a half-breed son meant Benny was under even further
strain. Details of this period can be found in the excellent anthology <i>Life
During Wartime</i> and concluded in the audio adventure <i>Death and the Daleks</i>
(which ties up loose ends, reveals long hinted secrets, sees the death of a regular
character and includes the Daleks too), but please read the stories in order
and be prepared for a shock or two along the way, not least of which the secret
behind the Fifth Axis.... </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><img width=160 height=139 src="benny_files/image008.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black'>Since the conclusion of the Fifth Axis story line, Benny and friends
have returned to the usual run of the mill lives; so like they say “no rest for
the wicked”-or it seems archaeology professors!</span></p>
