<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>There was an enormous chasm
called <span style='color:black'>Ginnungagap that separated the worlds of fire
(Muspelheim) and ice (Niflheim). The actions of these two extreme domains created
a giant called Ymir and a cow called Audhumbla whose milk fed and nourished Ymir.
Ymir was father of all the Frost Giants (the Jotun) and while he lay sleeping
in </span></span><img width=151 height=171 src="worldtree_files/image001.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Ginnungagap, Audhumbla
licked the salt in his armpit and formed the first of the gods: Buri.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Buri fathered Bor
who married the giantess Bestla and they had three sons, the brothers Odin, Vili
and Ve. Together the brothers killed Ymir and from his flesh and blood they
made the land and the sea. They took his skull and filled it with sparks from Muspelheim
and this became the heavens with the sun, moon and stars. They used the giant’s
eyebrows to create Midgard, and on Midgard they created Ask (Ash) and Embla
(Elm), the first man and woman, from trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The cosmos now
consisted of nine worlds: Niflheim, Muspelheim, Midgard (the home of Man), Vanaheim
(home of the Vanir), Asgard (or Asaheim – home of the Aesir), Alfheim (or Ljosalfheim
– home of the Ljosalfar or light-elves), Svartalfheim (home of the Svartalfar
or dark-elves), Jotunheim (home of the Jotun), Nidavellir (the mines, home of
the dwarves). Midgard was situated between Nifleim, which became the land of
the dead and Asgard, the home of the gods. Asgard could only be reached by
crossing the rainbow bridge, Bifrost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>In the centre of
all the worlds was Ygddrasil, the world tree. Ygddrasil formed the celestial
axis about which the worlds were arranged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=war></a><b><span style='font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Vanir Gullveig was
extremely fond of gold, to the extent that she spoke of nothing else (sounds
like a stereotypical dwarve). Trouble is the Aesir got a mite fed up with her
and tried to shut her up by spearing her and burning her. Unfortunately for
them she kept coming back to life. This however upset the Vanir and they declared
war on the Aesir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>In some ways this could be
seen as the war of Nature against Civilisation – one that neither side could
win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Aesir found that
although they were fierce warriors they kept losing so they decided to call a
truce and acknowledge the Vanir as their equals. <span style='color:black'>As a
condition of this truce hostages would be exchanged.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=98 height=179 src="worldtree_files/image002.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Vanir sea god Njord with
his son and daughter, Frey and Freya would go to the Aesir along with the wise Kvasir
(who was formed from the spit of both sides to seal the truce (eeee-ew!!)),
while in return the Vanir were sent Mimir and Hoenir. At first the Vanir were
very happy with Hoenir and Mimir as they both seemed to be extremely wise; that
is until they found out that Hoenir only seemed wise because the truly wise Mimir
was telling him what to say. As a result the Vanir chopped of Mimir’s head and
sent it back to the Aesir – motto: don’t try and deceive the Vanir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Aesir however were very
happy with Njord and his children and they were offered a place amongst the Aesir
(though Njord’s wife stayed in Vanaheim because she was also his sister and
incest was frowned upon in Asgard). As for Mimir’s head; Odin kept it,
preserved it and due to his skills and magic was able to continue to consult
the wise Mimir (Necromancy I presume, though Odin is also seen as a psychopomp
so this may not strictly be the case).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Notable Deities</span></b></p>

<p><a name=baldur></a><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Balder</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> – beautiful and well loved Balder was the joy of the
gods. Balder had a prophetic dream that he would die, murdered, and that this
would be a precursor to Ragnarok. His mother, Frigg, took action and made all
things in the nine worlds swear not to harm Balder. As a result Balder was
immune to harm as spears would turn aside rather than hit him. However Loki learnt
that Frigg had not asked the mistletoe to take this vow and so he fashioned a
weapon of mistletoe wood. Balder and the Aesir played a game where weapons
would be thrown at him to test his invulnerability,  and true to their vows all
weapons turned aside. Seeing his chance, Loki gave the mistletoe to Balder’s
blind brother, Hod the god of darkness. Hod eagerly threw the dart at Balder
but of course the dart did not turn aside and Balder was killed.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Frigg was distraught and Hermod (Balder’s
other brother), rode on Sleipnir to beg Hel to let Balder return to life. Hel
agreed provided all things shed a tear in mourning for him. Everything cried in
its own way, the sky rained, and all creatures wept. All except a giantess, Thokk,
who refused. Balder was then doomed to stay in Hel’s domain, but his wife Nanna
had died of grief and he was content to stay there.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Later it was discovered that Thokk was
actually Loki and in punishment he was condemned to spend the time until Ragnarok
chained to a rock with a viper spiting venom in his face. His wife Sigyn,
goddess of fidelity (and to stick with Loki she would have to be) stayed by his
side catching the venom in a bowl, but when the bowl was full and she emptied
it, Loki still suffered his punishment.<a name=frey></a></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Frey</span><span style='font-family:
Arial'> – one of the Vanir, a god of fertility and joy, Frey also has a hall in
Alfheim. In some descriptions he is described as a horned god, though this
probably refers to a ceremonial helm. His sister/wife is Freya and his father
is Njord. Statues of a sitting figure with an enlarged and erect penis are
generally attributed to Frey.</span></p>

style='font-family:Arial'> – sister of Frey, and also his wife in some tales, Freya
is a goddess of fertility and is often described as quite free with her
affection (well they do say it is the oldest profession). In one tale she
coveted the Brisingamen (either a girdle or a necklace) and to get it she had
to aggree to sleep with each of the dwarves that had created it.  Freya has a
chariot pulled by cats in which she travelled and is seen as the goddess of
witches and leader of the Valkyries.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Frigg</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> – Odins wife Frigg is a goddes of fertility and
marriage. In Anglo-Saxon myth she is merged with Freya and so Freya is then
seen as Odin (or Woden’s wife.)</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Heimdall</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> – guardian of Bifrost, Heimdall has exceptionally
acute senses and can see and hear across the nine worlds. He will summon the
forces of light to the battlefield by blowing the Gjallahorn at Ragnarok. Heimdall,
using the name Rig, is also said to have created the structure of human
society. He visited three homes and secretly slept with the wife of each house.
Each one bore a son named in turn; Thrall, Farmer and Lord. It is from these
that the three classes of mankind are descended.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Hel</span><span style='font-family:

sent to Niflheim and there given dominion over those that died of sickness, old
age and anything other than battle.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Loki</span><span style='font-family:
Arial'> – adopted brother to Thor, and giantborn. Loki is a god of fire, tricks
and half truths. He works to his own agenda, but his skills have at times
proved useful to the other gods. He has a number of monstrous children. His
daughter is Hel, and he is also father or Jormungandr the Midgard Serpent, that
coils round the Earth awaiting Ragnarok, and Fenris the wolf fated to kill Odin
himself. His only welcome child is Sleipnir, a horse with eight legs and given
to Odin as his steed. Sleipnir is the fastest of horses and can go anywhere.
Surprisingly Loki is Sleipnir’s mother.</span></p>

style='font-family:Arial'> – called also Wotan and Woden, Odin is the
all-father, chief of the gods. He gave an eye to gain wisdom and sacrificed
himself to himself, hanging on the World Tree to gain the secret of the runes,
which he then shared with man. Odin walks the Earth in many guises and under
many names, one eyed he is accompanied by the wolves Geri and Freki, while the
ravens Hugin (thought) and Munin (memory) whisper into his ears what they see
when they range through the nine worlds. Odin has a hall,</span><span
 style='font-family:Arial'>Valhalla</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>
where the souls of noble warriors are brought by the Valkyries. These warriors
spend their days feasting and fighting awaiting Ragnarok when they will ride

god for the common people. He is god of thunder and storms and wields the
hammer Mjollnir (shatterer). He is immensly strong but still needs to don his
enchanted girdle and gloves to lift Mjollnir. Many followers of Thor wear a
Mjollnir charm as a sign of their faith.</span></p>

war, but also of honour. When Loki’s children were brought to Asgard, Fenris
was found to break all his bonds so a magical binding was prepared but Fenris
suspected a trap and would only let them put it on him if a god would put his
hand in his jaws. The only god that would do this was Tyr who knew that to do

is presaged by Balder’s death and the dread Fimbulwinter, a period of intense
winter that lasts for three years without giving way to spring. Then the forces

will fight aided by the Einherjar, the chosed warriors from </span><span

and then his flames will rise up and burn the universe to ashes.</span></p>
