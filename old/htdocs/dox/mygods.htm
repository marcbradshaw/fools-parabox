<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I believe in
Gods, but not all Pagans do.</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:black'> That might sound a bit odd considering that a religion would seem
to need a focus, but in truth not all paths fit this perceived description:
indeed it is possible to have faith in many things other than 'supernatural'
entities. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=106 height=143 src="mygods_files/image001.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Some Pagans
follow a path that honours well defined deities; others follow a path where
deities are seen as different aspects of a single or dual divine power. Some
work with spirits and energies but do not consider them as gods and some see
the gods as nothing more than archetypes of the human subconscious. So where
does my faith lie?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Simply put, I do
not know whether the beings I relate to as gods are real entities or parts of
my subconscious, but as they seem real to me I feel it would be impolite to
think of them as mere figments of my imagination, so I honour them as discrete
entities, for which the term 'gods' seems an apt description.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>However things
are not quite so simple in practice and there are two types of 'gods' in my
path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The first of
these are the Goddess and her consort the Horned God. While there are 'horned'
gods a plenty, and indeed I have a relationship with one in particular, the
Lord and Lady in this case are unnamed and I regard them as little more than
archetypes representing the seasonal changes in the yearly cycle. Theirs is the
story told by the Wheel of the Year and, in particular, by the 8 sabbats of
Wicca. It is through them that I honour Nature and by their stories mark the
changing seasons. These 'gods' are not beings in their own right, rather they
are just conceptual tools to better facilitate my understanding of the mystery
cycle of Nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=134 height=104 src="mygods_files/image002.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The beings that
I recognise as 'real' gods are entities that manifest in various ways and forms
and present themselves as named and recognisable individuals. Thus to me all
gods are separate and autonomous beings driven by their own motives and
governed by their own feelings. That being the case I do believe that many
individual names and titles may be used by the same god, particularly across
diverse cultures, and that much of the histories attributed to the each god are
more a case of mans attempt to understand the nature of a god than factual
documentation of a god's deeds or familial relationships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>So who are my
gods?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>I generally
worship two gods; notice that by worship I do not imply that I commit myself to
their control, that is not something that they would seem to require, rather I
hold them in a place of esteemed honour, I offer them tribute and honour, in
return they offer me friendship, guidance and support. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>It is not the
place for my gods to dictate my life, nor is it my privilege to expect them to
sort out my life for me. They are not jealous gods, nor are they unkind. If I
had to explain the nature and the sort of relationship that we have, I think
the closest I can come is to describe them as honest and trusted mentors. They
are certainly honest, sometimes brutally so, and they have earned my trust, as
I have earned theirs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=114 height=151 src="mygods_files/image003.jpg"
align=left hspace=4 alt="herne - (C) kev the cosmic fool www.foolsparadox.co.uk"><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Now the first of these I encountered I
know as </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> (or to some Cerne). He is usually human,
not of a tall build - though he seems to tower just the same and often sports
the antlers of what I believe to be a red dear. Note the antlers are growing
from his head, though at other times he is bareheaded. Often he is naked and,
as you would expect for a god of fertility, well endowed! Other times he wears
a cloak of living vegetation, possibly rooted in his skin - a green man in
other words, or sometimes a quite ordinary looking three piece suit in sage
green - he reminds me of a bank manager at these times. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The one thing
that is constant is his scent. Yes my god smells! It’s a strong odour that
seems to be a mix of musk and the smell you get in a wood after a rainstorm.
While strong, it is not unpleasant and in some ways even attractive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> is known to history and myth as the
leader of the wild hunt, god of both hunter and prey and also of fertility and
ale. He is described as a psycho pomp, someone who guides spirits from life to
afterlife, and Lord of the wild beasts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Legend says that
</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> was the favourite huntsmen of Richard II
who was injured during a hunt and when healed by a 'mysterious' stranger was
left with strange powers and a kinship with beasts. The king's other huntsmen
became jealous and plotted his downfall. Driven to suicide he hung himself from
an oak tree in </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Windsor</span><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Great</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Park</span><span style='font-family:

since then,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=133 height=173 src="mygods_files/image004.jpg"
align=right hspace=4></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>While the legend
gives </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> a relatively recent genesis he has been
around since Anglo-Saxon times if not earlier and has been linked with the
Celtic figure of Cernunnos to such a degree that the two are now widely thought
of as one. Furthermore there are a number of place names that appear to echo
Herne (or the alternate Cerne) including </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Herne</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Bay</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>, Herne Hill, Cerne Abbas, the River Cerne and others. Links
have been made by various sources to Odin, Frey, Pan, Hermes/Mercury and a number
of other beings, all I know however is that for me he is '</span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>'.</span></p>

align=left hspace=4
alt="andred, andraste,anderida,adraste (C) www.foolsparadox.co.uk Kev the cosmic fool"><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>My goddess is Andred, she revealed
herself to me much later than did Herne, but she had been there in the
background for some time. She is an interesting but also little known goddess.
Known as Adraste/Adrasta, Anderida and Andraste to the Celts and Romans (the
Roman town that became modern Pevensey was named Anderida presumably in her
honour) she was worshipped by the Iceni queen Boudicca (Boadicea) as the
goddess of Victory in battle, but also has attributes of a lunar and mother
goddess. The centre of her influence in </span><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:black'>Britain</span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> was
seen as the forest that covered much of what is now </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Sussex</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> and </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Kent</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> and the remains of which form the area
known today as the Weald. This is derived from the Anglo-Saxon Andredsweald,
Andred being the name by which the Saxons knew her. Little is known about
Andred but I have found her to be harsh but fair, demanding but forgiving and
someone who expects you to prove yourself. She is also rather fond of hares.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>She has been
linked to Innana/Ishtar, Aphrodite/Venus, Artemis/Diana and Freya but again for
me she has given </span><img width=154 height=197
src="mygods_files/image006.jpg" align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>the name Andred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Like </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'>, Andred has come to me in several forms, though less
diverse.  I usually see her as a pale skinned lady with long blonde hair, and a
silvery 'glow', she tends to favour long and flowing robes in very pale pastels
or plain white. She looks almost like she is composed of moonlight. At other
times she has shown herself with dark hair and wearing green, and on one
occasion she showed me a much more fearsome face, with sharp teeth and cruel
eyes - this was part of a lesson, one that I needed to learn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>These are the
two deities that I have a relationship with, but that does not mean that I
disbelieve in other gods. It simply means that of all the deities out there it
was </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Herne</span><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> and Andred who came to me. Other gods
may turn up from time to time (though of course some<i> might</i> be Herne or
Andred in other guises - they might not tell me) but so far I have only built a
relationship with these two.</span></p>
