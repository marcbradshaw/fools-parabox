align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The story of
what happened to scupper the future of Crusade would probably take up more
space than an overview of the episodes that were made. However, in the
interests of legality, let me just say that the TV company (TNT) had a
radically different view as to the look and direction of the show than its creator,
JMS. The full story can be found on the WWW with ease so I shall not dwell on
it here other than to say that I do wonder why TNT thought they knew more about
how the show should have been than its creator, especially when JMS could point
to the success of </span><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The order of
episodes broadcast is not the preferred order to tell the story arc that JMS
planned (thank you TNT), but it is not easy to watch them in the right order
because of a change in uniform (thank you again TNT). In fact the first
episode, continuing from A Call to Arms, was shown after a new batch of six
episodes that TNT requested to act as an origin (er..isn’t that what the pilot
movie was all about?) and introduce the characters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Now on to the
show:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The <i>Excalibur</i>,
under the command of Captain Mathew Gideon (Gary Coleman), has been assigned to
track down a cure for the Drakh plague that has been let loose on the Earth.
His crew includes John Matherson (Daniel Dae Kim), </span><img width=138
height=132 src="babcrusade_files/image003.jpg" align=left hspace=4><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>a telepath operating in Earthforce under
the new guidelines in place since the telepath war and the downfall of Psi
Corps, Dr Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden) and IPX representative Max Eilersen
(David Allen Brooks). Also on the ship is Dureena Nafeel (Carrie Dobro) thief
and last member of a race wiped out by the Shadows, and occasionally rogue
technomage Galen (Peter Woodward).&nbsp; Galen and Gideon have a previous
history (Galen rescued Gideon after his ship, the <i>Cerberus</i>, abandoned
him in deep space), but Gideon is also in possession of a mysterious artefact,
an apocalypse box, which offers him advice; including not to trust the
technomage. The <i>Excalibur</i> will also be a regular visitor to </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> 5 (maybe because of its location) and a relationship is
beginning to develop between Gideon and Lochley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The general
procedure is that the Rangers report details of any leads they pick up and then
the <i>Excalibur</i> follows them up. In the episodes that were produced we
learn of the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The plague is a
nanotech virus and is airborne. Once infection has taken place the virus
expands (a bit like unpacking a ZIP file on a PC). The virus mutates regularly
exploiting various diseases that prey on man; as a result there are sudden
groupings of </span><img width=118 height=86 src="babcrusade_files/image004.jpg"
align=right hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>deaths caused
by the same unexpected outbreak of a disease. This indicates that the virus is
coordinating its progress; which ties up with a discovery on a similar nanotech
virus on a planet which is controlled by a central computer, which once
destroyed renders the virus inert (and the inert virus can be reprogrammed to
act as a <i>temporary</i> shield against the Drakh plague). A planet that was
subjected to the same plague by the Shadows is discovered, but the people did
not find a cure and instead went into hibernation luring other races to the
planet in the hope that by dissecting them they would find a solution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>There are a
handful of self contained episodes included in the few made, but whether they
would have had any later bearing we shall never know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>The irony is
that TNT cancelled Crusade both before the completion of the first series and
before the show had even aired. Even more irony is to be found in the fact that
the arc itself was only just beginning at the point when TNT pulled the plug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=117 height=84 src="babcrusade_files/image005.jpg"
align=left hspace=4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>What can be
inferred though from online sources is that the declared five year mission to
cure the Earth would have evolved; with the cure being found much sooner than
expected (my guess is that there was a computer controlling the virus (may be
on the moon??) and that by destroying this, the plague is defeated).
Developments would have followed up the <i>Cerberus</i> thread and have
revealed a conspiracy within Earthforce (another one??) concerning the use of
advanced alien technologies (perhaps Shadow tech from their liaison with the </span><span
 style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Clark</span><span style='font-family:
Arial;color:black'> administration); possibly with Gideon going undercover and
being shot at the climax to the season…..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>What would have
happened regarding the apocalypse box (people usually die after owning it), the
technomages (currently hiding somewhere) and the Drakh (would this have lead to
the battle for Centauri Prime and Sheridan and Delenn’s captivity??) we may
never know </span><span style='font-family:Wingdings;color:red'>L</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

episode listing for </span></b><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Babylon</span></b><b><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:black'> 5 is not planned at present but here is
a listing of what we got and what might have been with Crusade:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>War Zone</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Where the Excalibur gets a
crew, some of which we have already met, and a Drakh official is a well won
prize.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>First episode, was made 6<sup>th</sup> and starts off as
an introduction – handy if you haven’t seen A Call to Arms – which was now a
long time ago though only a couple of days in story continuity.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The Long Road</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where Earthforce finds that strip mining a planet is not without its
problems and Gideon learns that dragons are a technomage’s best friend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The Well of
Forever</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where Galen teaches many lessons in his pursuit of closure, and telepath
examiner, Mr Jones finds out just how single minded Dureena can be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>The one with the big amorous alien jellyfish.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The Path of
Sorrows</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where the recovery of a strange englobed alien shows that forgiveness is
not an easy gift to accept. Galen meanwhile finds himself going no-where very
fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Patterns of the
Soul<br>
</span></b>Where refugees from Earth find they have the plague while Gideon
finds a conspiracy. Dr Chambers finds more than she expected and Dureena finds
some ‘family’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>First use of the nanotech shield granting 48 hours of
immunity to the plague – pity that it isn’t discovered yet due to TNT’s
rescheduling of episodes.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Ruling From the
Tomb</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where a visit to Mars results in murder, dancing, and a terrorist with a
hotline to God. Gideon finds his conversations with Lochley over a meal are
hard to swallow – without choking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I laughed out loud at the meal scene – excellent stuff</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The Rules of
the Game</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where a visit to Babylon 5 reunites Gideon with Lochley and results in a
lethal game of tag with some overly xenophobic aliens. Meanwhile Max gets to
play white knight to his ex-wife and cat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Appearances and
Other Deceits<br>
</span></b>Where a visit by a pair of Earthforce PR advisers leads to a change
in wardrobe. Meanwhile the Excalibur crew finds that one alien mind can go
along way<span style='font-family:Arial'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>This change in uniform was prompted by TNT requesting
different costumes. The ‘new’ uniforms were the original ones and would have
been ‘lost in the laundry’ after the pre-recorded episodes had been completed –
that is if the show had not been cancelled. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Racing the
Night</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where a visit to a dead world finds that previous victims of the plague
settled on a rather grisly means of research – research that is still in
progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>The Memory of
War</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where it seems that a dead world (another one) holds a deadly secret
(again).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>This episode introduces a similar virus that provides
both the source of the nanotech shield (that they already have – thanks again
TNT) and offers some possible clues both to how the Drakh plague may be
disabled and to the secrets of the technomages.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:red'>The Needs of Earth</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where an alien refugee holds the forbidden secrets of his
race. Secrets that his people will stop at nothing to destroy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Very sad</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Visitors From
Down The Street</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where the Excalibur gets drawn into the paranoid conspiracies of an
alien government and its own version of the X-Files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Each Night I
Dream of Home</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where Dr Stephen Franklin (infected with the virus and thus quarantined)
comes on board to oversee an experiment to chart the Drakh plague.&nbsp; The
Drakh launch an attack to prevent this and Lochley returns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A major turning point in the plague arc. We learn some
details of how the plague virus works and so added to info from The Memory of
War a cure begins to seem within reach - and then they cancelled it!!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i><img border=0
width=227 height=88 src="babcrusade_files/image006.jpg"></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Had the series continued the
following would have probably completed the first season:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Value
Judgements</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where we learn that Bester survived the telepath war and is now a hunted
criminal. This may have focussed on John Matherson, Gideon’s telepathic first
officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>Tried and True</span></b><span
style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where Dureena is put on trial by her teacher in the Thieves Guild
(branches everywhere: Earth, Mars, Babylon 5, Ankh-Morepork) for hanging round
with the authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red'>To The Ends Of
The Earth</span></b><span style='font-family:Arial'><br>
</span>Where Gideon goes on the trail of the strange (Shadow-like) &nbsp;ship
that destroyed his former ship the <i>Cerberus</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>In the Path of Sorrows we saw a flash back that showed
Gideon being marooned in space after a strange ship destroyed the Cerberus. The
ship had definite signs of Shadow technology, but wasn’t a Shadow ship that we
had seen before. Gideon was saved by Galen.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:red'>The End of the Line</span></b><br>
Where Gideon follows up the leads on the strange ship and uncovers a deadly
agenda within Earthforce itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Rumour is the season would have ended with Gideon being
shot. The Drakh plague would have been resolved either by now or during the
next season (perhaps – it was basically there just to set up the series, much
like the raiders in the first season of Babylon 5) and the Earthforce arc would
have explored the unsanctioned use of Shadow technology – perhaps that ship was
a prototype, a Shadow/Earthforce version of the Vorlon/Minbari ships that would
comprise the White Star Fleet?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interestingly the aborted movie – The Memory of Shadows
would have featured Galen investigating the use of Shadow technology in a
similar way, perhaps this would have covered some of the story threads lost
here – oh well another lost chance.</b></p>
